Great theater to see 1st release movies. Cine' Capri is AWESOME! Get there early or go on Monday morning to avoid crowds. Other theaters are more than adequate for watching end enjoying any movie. Local area restaurants are varies casual to mildly dressy (it is Scottsdale after all). Senior discounts are offered too.,1
I would like to thank Shelley Hunt for giving me the most beautiful hair! My hair was so fine &broken! Shelley put extentions in my hair & they are great! Easy to care for &look so natural! I haven't felt good about my hair for years now I am in love with my hair!! Thank you Shelley!!,1
"Showmar's, like many of the restaurants in Charlotte, is owned by a Greek family and features American meets Greek food at their chain of locations.  Showmars does american greek better than the most, and they are typically quite busy, especially during lunch time.  I recommend the chicken fiesta pita if you want to go Greek, or the all-american pita burger if you want something less traditional.",1
"I've been here a couple times and will always return.\n\nLine waits are usually never that long.\n\nI always get the Italian sandwich, no cheese. Super good, but you must eat right away or the dressing will make it a little soggy.\nTheir Mac salad is ok. The pasta salad is kind of bland. I wouldn't recommend things from the cold case in front for these reasons. \n\nDeducting a star because my sister said her prime rib sandwich was dry and they over charged us for the pasta salad.",1
Best sandwiches in Las Vegas! Awesome choices and completely customizable. Don't forget an order of fresh cut potato chips or fries seasoned to your liking. Top it off with a perfect dill pickle... Heaven!,1
"Have gone here for years, through several owners and the food has been great almost every time. Once in a while they get really skimpy on the portions or seem to lower the quality of the ingredients (change of management? ownership?) but maybe people back off and they realize it and return to the good stuff; not sure. Food is great, prices are decent, portions are generous. Staff is hit or miss and usually hanging out with friends or regulars, making it hard to get attention sometimes, but it's part of the atmosphere. In reference to the take-out comments below, we've begun to do that more only because we can't stand the hookah smoke (sorry hookah peeps!) but that fruit smoke does not mix well with food. They'd be well served to create an outdoor area for the smokers and the non-smokers - especially since cigarette smokers join in as well. Unfortunately, the huge indoor area they have is weird and gross, which is probably why there's never anyone in there. All that said, the food here is good so it's definitely worth trying.",1
"who's ready to parrrtayyy! my girls and I had sooooo much fun! i wish we could have stayed longer, but our feet just would not allow. Different rooms with different music. If you just want to dance your heart out stop on by.. try and pre-game because drinks are an arm and a leg. Thank god we made friends with a promoter, who 1. got us in free and skipped the line, and 2. gave us each a drink voucher, or else we would have had to pay 26 bones for a shot of patron! *gasps*...i know! terrifying!. but all in all a must stop when in town!",1
"No complaints. Greg was our server. He was very professional, upbeat, and very attentive. The customer service ment a lot to me. I will continue to come back and enjoy this wonderful restaurant. Food was delicious,  prices were great.",1
"We take our daughter here and love love the staff.  We usually see the PA Eryn (sp?) and she is great with our kiddo.  The MAs are also great there.  I can call and ask a question about something regarding our daughter and get a prompt response if not then and there when i call.  As a first time parent, that is quite a blessing!\n\nSo it is a little strange that old people and younglings go to the same office but if you can get past that, it's totally worth going, especially if you live in the area.  The staff is great and so is our daughter's board certified pediatrician, Dr. Johnson.  They are not particularly pushy about one opinion or another which I feel like is a good thing.",1
"It's a half mile away, I can run in and out in a  few minutes without aisles and aisles of streamlining children and preening mommies, there are lots of really, really good deals, and the guy who cooks up the samples (I'm embarrassed I forgot his name) has some great ideas.\nWhat more can you ask for???  OK, OK, if you like to inspect each apple, choose from 12 varieties of granola, etc., you won't like it.  \nFor example, choices of apples are usually four packs of either Gala, Fuji, or Granny Smith.  Take or leave.  BTW, the Fujis are usually the best.\nThe F&E brand items are hit or miss, mostly hit.  I like the F&E putenesca sauce.  Come to think of it, there have been a few \""""misses\"""" but I cannot remember them... (remember the over 40 bit, Ok?).  The olive tapenade tastes straight out of an Italian deli, the stuffed baked potatoes are a great meal in a pinch.  The giant boxes of mixed salad greens are a staple in our house.\nThe meat selection is pretty darn extensive - a variety of pork and beef cuts, sausages, and sometimes even lamb. They have chicken also, but since I am allergic to it I never paid it much attention.  The cooked shrimp makes a good quick meal - either get a package that includes the cocktail sauce packets or get a bottle from the condiments aisle (the F&E brand is surprisingly good).  The tilapia is excellent.  Grill with a  little salt and olive oil. \nFor ease and budget-tending, I love F&E.  Tip:  Avoid Sundays, as that is when their stock is lowest.",1
"While visiting Scottsdale, we had to stop and try out the Chicago style pizza place.  YUM!  Got us a nice deep dish and tasted like many back home.  Fun 'little italy' atmosphere, nice courtyard though it was a little chilly for us to sit outside when we were there.  We had a bigger group that included kids so we were sat in a little side building on the other side of the courtyard from the main restaurant.  It was still cute, but definitely secluded-a little weird.  Our server, Irene, was very friendly, always on top of things and made our experience great.  Will definitely be back on the next trip!",1
"Best Indian food in Charlotte. I used to go to copper all the time but now I usually drive to Ballantyne if I want Indian because blue taj is just awesome. You seriously can't beat the value of the lunch deal. Soup/salad, curry dish, naan, and a side of spiced potatoes and rice, all for about $11-12. I just love the richness and depth of flavor in the curries. Give it a try.",1
"Dara Thai is probably the best place to dine in Anthem in regards to quality of food. They have an extensive menu with most of the traditional Thai dishes along with \n\nHere are some recommendations: \nFor apps, veggie rolls, crab wontons are ok, but go with the Satay ~ slices of chicken marinated in curry and grilled. It comes with peanut sauce and cucumber dip which is not actually dip, it's yummy pickled cucumber slices in this ridiculous somewhat sweet sauce that may entice you lick the bowl and ask for more...  \n\nSoups; their Koew Num (wonton) soup is good however I suggest going for the Tom Ka Gai which is a hot/sour soup with chicken, lemon grass, mushrooms, something else not sure what is but taste good in a coconut milk broth served in a \""""flaming soup tureen\"""".  \n\nDinner/Lunch; Pad Thai, Kao Pad Kari, Panang Curry are all good and you would not be disappointed but I recommend either Pad Gaeng Pa Curry or Goong Gartiem Prik Thai ~ shrimp dish with garlic, snow peas, onions and broccoli.  They also have a few nontraditional Thai dishes like Orange chicken and Beef with Broccoli in case your with someone that is not a fan of Thai cuisine. \n\nHeat levels are somewhat conservative so you may need to order a little hotter than at other locations. Service is friendly and quick.  Their prices are very reasonable and their portions are on the larger size, so you can share with someone if you choose to.",1
"OH MAN!! I am seriously addicted to their Pink Champaigne Petit Fours (TO DIE FOR!!!), and their frosted sugar cookies are a big hit around the office! I haven't gotten anything here that hasn't been fantastic! One of the best tiramasus I've had in a long time, and their cupcakes rival Sprinkles all day long!\n\nAlong with the delicious treats and beverages comes generally GREAT customer service, the gentlemen that work in the afternoon are super friendly and helpful! I did, unfortunately, have one bad experience with the woman they have working there Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, she was not pleasent or welcoming in any sort of way, and honestly made me feel like I was rather inconveniencing her by being there. I was SO shocked by the whole experience since I've been going in pretty regularly for a couple months now and had never had anything negative to say, until then. I remember thinking, \""""Geez, I sure hope that's NOT Barb, and if it is, perhaps she's best suited for strictly baking...in the back...as far away from customers as possible!\"""" LOL\n\nSo, I do definitely recommend Barb's for cake and cookie lovers alike, you will DEFINITELY score big points with friends, family and co-workers!! Although, I would encourage all my sweet toothed brethren out there to not go Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, so as to avoid the cracken, she's just awful! Bon Apetit!!",1
Fun place for dinner or happy hour. Really helpful waitress suggested beers we might like to try based on what we told get were our current favorites. Delicious food.,1
"Little strange at first, but I have to admit service was great and I was very happy with the way my vehicle performed afterward. A little pressure for extras but overall happy with the experience.",1
"Pad Prik King is outstanding....\nMinan always gets the Thai Chili Basil, and loves it!",1
"For a place that doesn't hit any of my usual culinary hot buttons (ethnic, superb quality, fine wine list, creative) ... I still have to say that I do like Corbin's. Went there tonight after an unexplained hiatus of a few months (I was on hiatus, not Corbin's), and I realized that dinner was good, the previous lunches and dinners were good, service was good, atmosphere is good... and heck, while \""""good\"""" isn't fabulous, it ain't bad! \n\nThe burgers here are always a safe choice and all the varieties I've tried are tasty. The pizza thingies aren't my bag, but my dining companions have enjoyed them. The shredded pork salad is a great low-carb choice. Tonight I had the ahi appetizer. OK, the ahi wasn't the best quality - a little tough and very light pink -  but it was fresh and tasted just fine, especially for the price. The potato skins with pork were also tasty, and the husband liket the shrimp cocktail.\n\nIn summary, Corbin's isn't blow-your-socks-off good, but they are consistently decent, reasonably priced, and have decent service. Tonight's server was particularly good, striking the perfect balance of attentiveness and sincere friendliness without being pesky. \n\nMy husband looked up the $5/glass happy hour merlot on the internet to find that Wine Spectator gave it an 87. I wouldn't rank it anywhere near that high, but it's serviceable for $5/glass.",1
"Mystery Castle is the embodiment of eclectic.  The original owner built the \""""castle\"""" out of anything he could get his hands on, whether it was discarded bricks to empty liquor bottles.  It's really amazing to see the result of years of hard work and the knowledge that 2 years of architectural building school will achieve with just a little imagination.  Mystery Castle is the type of place you would have loved to run around and play hide and seek as a kid.  There are so many unique details that make the house itself a work of art.  Tours are held quite frequently, and you can jump in at any part of the tour and go to another one once your part of the tour is over.  Admission to tour the castle is $10.  Definitely a great place to take visitors for some quirky old school Arizona history!",1
"Best club in Vegas!!!! Loooove this place!\ngreat parties happen here!\nhave out door area that you can put your feet in jaccuzi or pool..\nGreat house DJs always plays here!\nDeadmou5, Kaskade, tiesto.... etc etc .\nIt's just so much fun!",1
I was very pleased to find another Hawaiian restaurant in Phoenix. Chicken katsu is good as is the mixed BBQ plate. If you crave an island style meal this is one of the few places I've found in the valley.,1
"Went back to North on Saturday night.  Have not been there for a few years.  I stopped going since the quality of the food did not match the pricing.   It was good but not spectacular.  Atmosphere is always great and full of energy.  \n\nMuch better experience this time around.  We started with the calamari appetizer.  Calamari were tender and tasty, however, there were not enough to my liking and presentation was not very good.  Calamari were in pieces or broken.  At this type of restaurant I would expect nice round calamari rings embedded in the tender arugula served with the calamari.\n\nThe entrees were much better.  I had the braised beef short rib gnocchi with horseradish cream.  Excellent dish.  Very flavorful and gnocchi were al dente.  Beef was melt in your mouth tender. Dish was  definitely on the rich side, but worth it.  My wife decided on the salmon.  Perfectly cooked to her liking.  The creamy farro side was outstanding, almost like a risotto.\n\nService was very good.  Waiter was very busy, but was efficient and attentive.",1
"It was during our annual Thanksgiving trip to Vegas that we came across this cafe. My boyfriend and I needed to fuel up before we head out to the outlet for some serious shopping. We wanted pancakes so I did a quick Google search under \""""Best brunch in Vegas\"""" and this came up as one of the 10. I have the tendency to look up menus to see if anything jumps out at me before I actually head there...the red velvet pancakes got me.\n\nThis cafe ended up being a little further than I expected off the strip...but wasn't hard to find. \n\nTo our surprise, we walked into a Filipino owned restaurant! It's as if the motherboard was calling my boyfriend home! :p As we got to our seat, I kept seeing patrons munching on a breakfast burrito and I couldn't find it on the menu at all! Whenever there's a breakfast burrito on the menu, I had to get it. So being too shy to ask, I ended up ordering Baby Chick Omelette with a side upgrade of the red velvet pancakes. My boyfriend didn't go far from his homeland and ordered the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice with a short stack of the Rocky Road pancakes. \n\nThe service was casual and quick. We got our food not too long after and as soon as it came, we dove in...after taking pictures of our food, OF COURSE! My Baby Chick Omelette was good and definitely loaded! The red velvet pancakes were good but I think Larchmont Bungalow in LA makes it better. I had a bite of the Adobo Fried Rice. It was good but a little dry for my taste. My boyfriend loved it though. His Rocky Road pancakes were to die for!!! It's ice cream in carbs form. Yum!!\n\nI think this establishment is a great change from your strip buffets and overpriced food. I would definitely come here again. \n\nAs we went to the front to pay, I noticed behind their cashier was a blackboard of....their specials. And guess what was on their...the burrito. :( Lesson learned...ALWAYS CHECK OUT THE BLACKBOARD FOR SPECIALS!",1
"Shits poppin. Would give five stars but lids on to-go cups are a little iffy. Also damn how many characters do I need to type for this to be a review, the world needs to hear my voice fam",1
So happy this place is literally 5 minutes away from my house! The food here is delicious and the service is great! They also deliver!! And they have lunch specials on the weekdays from 11am to 4pm! Their Mongolian beef is my favorite!,1
"I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it.",1
"This Mexican restaurant is close to my in-laws place so we recommended giving it a try one Sunday after church. We heard this was related to Baja Joe's in Mesa, but it is in fact not. But the menu is almost identical. We have been craving fish tacos, so we ordered the Red Snapper, whole fish,  cooked in garlic.  They have very good quality tortillas I must say. We used the tortillas to make a little burrito with the garlic fish and added the delicious chipotle sauce and habanero hot sauce to give it a good kick. Those were delicious. I must say they could use a reassessment of the salad they serve because they were wilted and just did not look good. The fish was also a bit smaller than I expected considering the price and when compared to Baja Joe's. I also got to try my brother-in-law's shrimp burrito - enchilada style and i must say it was HUGE! Also, they were generous with the perfectly cooked shrimp! My mother-in-law got the carne asada and that was cut pretty thin and wasn't as juicy as I expected, so I don't think I would recommend it. The ambiance of the restaurant is basically as if you walked into Mexico, it compliments the food in my opinion! The service was great, the waitress was very attentive and was very helpful when we had questions, even with a decently packed house. I am definitely planning on coming back for another round, and I'm glad we got to give it a try!",1
"I came in an hour before close and although some staff were cleaning, I didn't feel rushed to get my froyo and get out. Everyone was really friendly and the place was amazingly clean!",1
"Great neighborhood chinese. Affordable, delicious, and great customer service. Volcano Shrimp will change your life!",1
"Alice Cooperstown is, as my husband said, \""""like a Hard Rock that's not stupid.\""""  The concept is a bizarre combo of Alice Cooper and a sports bar - and it works.  \n\nWe stopped by two other places to check out their menus before a game, and they didn't look very thrilling.  The menu at Cooperstown is pretty extensive - lots of options.  \n\nThe service was very quick and efficient.  I see no reason to go anywhere else before a D-Backs game.",1
"They had me at fresh squeezed pineapple juice.  We were in Scottsdale for spring training and came here on the advice of a friend.  Thank you, friend!  We enjoyed our meal so much we came back the following day.  Again, fresh squeezed pineapple juice, heavenly.",1
"A huge thank you to Brian at Firestone! Yesterday evening I came into the shop ten minutes before closing. They put my spare tire on for me and had me setup to get a new tire in the morning. I got there at 7am and by 7:10am this morning I had a new tire and was off to work. Brian was friendly, quick and efficient. Before going to Firestone I had called Discount Tire to only get rudeness and a lot of sighs about them closing in 15 minutes. Thank you Brian for your awesome customer service! I will always choose Firestone over Discount Tire!",1
Fan-friggin-tastic!,1
"WHAT?  How on earth could this location be closed?!?  This is a staple whenever we visit Fremont street in vegas!  From the glow of the neon lights, this place is everything Vegas to me. \n\nI've actually only ever eaten their namesake Krispy Kreme donut, but that's quite heavenly enough for me.\n\nI hope when I come back to Fremont street that I'll find them opened up in another spot on the block!",1
"Here last night for dinner and I am IN LOVE! The decor is uber-chic with the warm tons and super cozy patio couches (upstairs and downstairs). My friend and I ate on the patio downstairs which overlooks the walking path, so perfect for a lazy Sunday experience. \n\nTwo tiny bads upfront: the Sangria; they only have red and it was pretty watered-down boring with only bar fruit. Weird. We switched to the house Merlot shortly thereafter which was fine. The service was sloooowwww which was odd since it was not very crowded. Tolerable, but slow. \n\nThe entrees, fantastic. They are about $23-$24 a piece. I had the duck, medium. It was unreal!!!! Delicious sauce and fantastic presentation. (Yes you must laugh with your date at this point recalling Christmas Story and no the duck does not come out with its head still on!!) :-D It was tender and sweet....perfection and well worth the wait. The risotto accompaniment was salty and not overdone - LOVED it!! \n\nMy friend got the crab-stuffed trout which he devoured. He totally got the Clean Plate Award and wouldn't let me try any of it! A sign that he was in love also (at least with the trout lol). \n\nThey will let you make reservations here for the patio if you have something coming up and want to be sure to be seated outside. A lot of restaurants won't guarantee patio, they will do a 'first come first served' basis for patio seating - blah..I don't like that (ahem Bricktops!!!) And when you make reservations you will get in their system...where they also log any allergies or special requests with your information - very nice!!! Love you Vivace!!! Cant wait to be back! :-D",1
"fantastic service, great food, cozy decor, i could spend a lot of money at this place, fantastic wine list, but again by the bottle at a huge mark up, would be nice if they were not so greedy with the wine prices, but the corkage is only $ 25.00 and that i can live with. somewhat overpriced even for the strip, but its darn good,  a pleasing array of menu items, wonderful service, i will be back,",1
"I love Earl of Sandwich! Ishhhh goood! The only reason i have ever tried this place was because i stayed at the planet hollywood and i came back from a night of partying and was sooooo hungry. Thank god this place was open 24 / 7 YO! So i decided to get a earls club which is a turkey bacon sandwich. It looked like a normal sandwich as i watched them prepair it. The place made the sandwich fast and was wrapped in a a nice foil that actually kept the sandwich warm for quite some time. I  also want to mention alot of the people getting sandwichs here at night are people they came back from partying and drinking alot.  Anyways i got my earls club brought it back to my room and just wanted something with bread in it to soak in the alcohol. First bite i toook of my EARL'S club and i was FEELING it! it WAS SOOO GOOOD! The bread had a nice crisp to it, it wasn't to crisp because u can feel the softness of it too. PLus the turkey and bacon made it really good. Most of the sandwichs at earl's i believe and HOT sandwichs. I just got a sandwich and it was only 5-7 dollars. For a late night snack this really hit the spot. I was thinking of getting another one before i went to bed but decided to just wait until i wake up to get another one! Hahaha Sooo now everytime i stay at planet hollywood, i have to earl's sandwich. I think the way they make their sandwichs plus the way they prepare and toast the sandwich is kind of unique. Their bread / sandwich's does have a distinct taste to it. Please try this sandwich place if your staying at planet hollywood. The line is long during the day and during the night it goes by pretty fast.",1
"Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.\n\nAn Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.\n\nFor our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.\n\nFor an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.\n\nSo in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not.",1
Be very specific up front if you need the interior glass cleaned and dashboard dusted. I've unfortunately driven away and not had a decent clean inside of the car. \nNice staff and hard workers! Be sure to tip the guys up front vacuuming and not just on the tail end... Think about it: which do you think is harder !? lol,1
"The wings here are excellent.  The \""""suicide\"""" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",1
"My experience at Delmonico Steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as I thought it would be.  First off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  All was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in Delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nThere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  At Delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. After the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nLike most five star restaurants, at Delmonico Steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nThe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. The space had a slightly Mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  No doubt because the restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly Italian theme througout. \n\nThe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  I think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  This combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nThe food was very good, however.  We started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  Followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye, and I ordered the bone-in NY strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  For sides, we shared a huge, delicious baked potato with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. For dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  Our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.",1
"I had work done elsewhere, here in Las Vegas and wasn't all that happy with the work. I took my new Stingray into Eco-Tint and had a clear bra and window tint done on it.

This is the only place I will use for all of my cars or recommend to any of my friends. Thanks Mike and Jay for your excellent care of my car and me.",1
"I'm a zoo snob.  We hit the zoo in every city we visit.  This place was very clean and VERY well organized, but I found it a little smaller than I was expecting.  \n\nIt's always a bit disappointing when the one animal you drove 400 miles to see (Leafy Sea Dragons) is \""""off-exhibit\"""", but I understand the need to clean the tank every once in a while or whatever they were doing.  Still, would have been nice to have a list online or something so that I would have known that and we could have planned accordingly.\n\nAs I said, the layout is great, a natural flow that takes you past everything, contrasted with some zoos which make you plan a multi-step route and back track for a mile.  This was far superior in that regard.",1
"I was the only early-afternoon customer when I visited. I got prompt, positive service and a very tasty salmon roll at a fair price.",1
"One thing I noticed about L& L is that they are not all made equal! This location is \""""okay \"""" as opposed to the one on Maryland and flamingo. The portions are huge which is great. I can usually get two meals out of my chicken katsu. The bf ordered BBQ short ribs. My food was fine, but his beef was SUPER salty. It was as if he was eating a beef flavored bouillon.  Usually salty is good, but this was a little over board. Hopefully it was a one time mistake as I love Hawaiian!!! \n\nThe dining area was nice and clean. They had lots of bamboo and lots of island pics. One of the few fast food joints I don't mind dining in. However, be aware when entering and exiting as the strip mall it is located in is not the safest and there are plenty of vultures preying on patrons to beg for money!",1
"This store has been in Pittsburgh for many years now and the people that work here are great.  They have a great game selection, with lots of Euro-type strategy games and puzzles.  The staff are all very knowledgeable and will give you helpful recommendations.  \n\nThey have a fun borrowing program, where you can borrow games for $5.  \nIf you return the game within a week, the $5 becomes store credit.\n\nThey often have demos out where you can try some new board games briefly.  And, they have a trade-in shelf for exchanging games with other people.  It's great they have a store like this  in Pittsburgh!",1

They have done a phenominal job of earning and keeping my business.",1
"This is my favorite ahwatukee Restraunt! It's damn good. \n\nI've been coming here since I was a kid, and I've never even tried any of their plates! I only ever get a b-fast burro, #12 with guac! Their salsa is fantastic, I could eat it with a spoon!  (and I have...)\n\nDfinately give this place a try! Mmm!",1
"I would recommend what we had during our visit...my daughter had combo #7 with pork and roasted duck over rice, my wife had delicious seafood egg noodle, my son had hard to find roasted duck porridge and i had wonderful roasted duck egg noodle with wanton, and the whole family shared a full plate side order of the famous roasted duck...theme of the day if you missed the pattern still...anything with ROASTED DUCK you cannot go wrong... :)",1
"While this may not be as scenic as Old Port or have as many attractions, this is a great place for a walk, jog, or bike ride.  There is a bike path that goes around the entire canal, and the it's not on the road either. It's actually a path and trail away from the cars and near the water, so you can bike at a leisurely pace.  In addition, along most of the canal is green space, so if you are tired, you can sit on the grass or bench and have a nice little picnic along the water.\n\nAll in all, maybe not an attraction for everyone, but it's a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.",1
"St. Cathrine had me majorly bummed out by the scene. Shopping trendy stores is not my deal. So I was really excited when I saw that familiar Lush sign. It means friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff, and wonderful smells!\nII bought a bath bomb to clear away the \""""hotel\"""" smell of my room, and got some great samples.",1
"Every once in a great while, you come across a place where, even after one visit, you know you'll be back for more. I'm sitting in the restaurant now, and feel the way I did when I had a new crush in high school: giddy. \n\nI can't exactly place it...maybe it's the generous portion of crinkle cut fries made to perfection or the creamy cheese sauce drizzled all over them. Maybe it was the fresh tasting burger, the lightly toasted sesame seed bun it came on, the cheddar cheese, or the special sauce that brought it all together. It's one of those burgers where you take the first bite and can't put it down...you don't even want to stop to use the ketchup you brought to the table specifically for the burger; it just disappears before you can realize what happened, and all you're left with is the fun music and fresh, clean atmosphere as you sit in the restaurant, wowed, and fantasizing about the next time you'll be back. \n\nI'm definitely coming back to try the Italian Beef and a shake. This place reminds me of home. Don't pass up an opportunity to have a great tasting burger for a reasonable price.",1
"Postinos is one of my favorite restaurants in Arcadia!  The actual building itself is an old converted post office, complete with a closing garage door.  Great wine selection and the staff is extremely helpful if you have any questions or need a recommendation.  \n\nAs for the food, it is phenomenal!  I've had the roast beef sandwich, turkey and brie, bruschetta, salads, you name it.  I have never once been disappointed with my meal here.\n\nI usually opt to split both a plate of bruschetta and a salad with a friend which is always more than enough.  My favorite salad is the raspberry chicken and for the bruschetta the brie/apple, salmon, pesto/salami, and fig/proscuitto are by far my faves.\n\nThis place is great for a first date, birthday, or dinner with a small group of friends :-) Looooove it!",1
"Stayed here a couple times, loved the pool, loved the SELF CHECK IN.  Try finding that in Vegas, people stand in line in for over 30 minutes, but you can easily walk over to the self check in and get your room with no fees.  Did I mention no hotel fees $15 per night... Not at Flamingo.  Ohh and its located right next to the monorail, so if you don't want to walk the long strip or are a great and got heels, stay here.  You are also in the middle of the strip.",1
"Hands down, best steak in town!\n\nOkay, so it is high time I finally review this place. I go here with my sister maybe... once every two months? Sometimes more frequently. We love it here. Originally, I was referred to this place by a very cheery funny and friendly Walmart Cashier on a shopping trip where my mother, for no real reason, had gotten noticeably stressed out. She suggested the place for a drink to calm her down - I didn't point out that we don't drink, but I filed the name away in my mind for future reference. It was possibly two years after that that I actually went here, and immediately loved it.\n\nAlright, so lets start with some slight flaws. Every place has them, and RWB is no exception. Mainly, the place is so popular, parking can be difficult at times, and the waiting area is lacking. So, if you go here on a busy night, you might be standing outside for a bit - BUT even with this, the food is worth it. \n\nEvery time I come here, the staff is wonderful and the food is amazing... but, I confess... I usually get the same thing every time. Medium marinated 10 oz. flat Iron steak with potatoes and a salad. \n\nBest. Thing. Ever. \n\nMy first few times here, I tried a few other things, but after giving the steak a try... I can't pass it up. And, let me say, I hate steak. I never eat it anywhere else because I hate chewing on boot-leather, and have never been pleased with it. Here, though, it is amazing - and the price can't be beat! Some other things on the menu are pricey, but the 10 oz. flat iron is an amazing deal for a fantastic steak. If you haven't tried it, you need to. I love it that the kitchen is viewable from the main dining room, which not only makes you feel a bit more secure about who's handling your food, but you can also see the head Chef working and maintaining his line of cooks - such a professional kitchen! \n\nAnd, of course, if your food is ever not how you ordered it, they take it back and fix it for you, no questions or fuss. Once, my sister's medium steak was clearly well done, no pink at all to it. When we pointed that out, the server took the steak back, we had another out very quickly, and were given an apology for the hassle. The service here is always a delight. \n\nSo, yes, once again best steak in town! Go try it. Now.",1
"If you like Cherry Blossom in Central Phoenix, you should thoroughly enjoy it's counterpart, Eastwind. Eastwind is one of my lunch go to spots because it is delicious, fairly-priced (you can get some of the same dishes as Cherry Blossom for cheaper) and has a friendly staff. \n\nMy list of must tries is simple. If you like Japanese curry, you gotta try the curry, rice and chicken katsu dish; it's fantastic and filling. The udon noodle soup is next on my list and is especially good if it's chilly outside; and I can't forget to say how good it is with shrimp tempura added to it. The best part about it is that it doesn't feel heavy or bog you down after eating it; you leave feeling re-energized. Last but not least is the lunch bento. Good lawd, it's scrumptious! Think of it as a sampler of sorts: you get your fish, your katsu, some miso, a salad and some rice. For $9 that's a lunch that'll fill you up and keep you full the rest of the day (unless you're not human of course, you pesky alien, you).\n\nGo here, eat the food, be nice to the staff and be prepared for a pleasant experience. It's a great place for a small group if you're into good atmosphere and Japanese cuisine.",1
I love Marie Callender's and this one didn't disappoint me.  The service was very quick and super friendly.   The food is great and the portions are good.   Eating here is always a good value and here it was a good experience.,1
"We had appetizer sampler, three cup black cod, the \""""diver's scallop\"""", lemon chicken.  The cod sauce was \""""to die for\"""" and the scallops were so tender and succulent!  The drinks were well poured.  Overall, 5 stars and that's because the overall food quality and spicing was excellent and spot-on.  AND the cod and scallops were phantastic [sic]!",1
First time here and I was extremely impressed with their hospitality.  The wait was about 20 minutes and while we waited the hostess came around and offered us cold water bottles to quench our thirst.  Once seated our waiter was quick to take our order and served our drinks promptly. The ambience was enjoyable and our food was served within minutes.  The only down side is the portions are small but overall great service!,1
"A lot of different emotions and opinions on the experience here. Main thing to note is this is a good place to go if you're not expecting a fancy Teppanyaki restaurant and you realize it's a good deal for the price. \n\nFirst thing is on the website it says that late night happy hour starts at 11pm, this is half true. Late night happy hour dinner area starts at 11pm, teppanyaki starts at midnight. Sushi rolls vary from $3.50-5 wide variety smaller than normal. You can order off full sushi menu at full price. Teppanyaki Filet mignon $16, seafood (calamari, crab sticks (imitation crab), scallops, shrimp $18.50. Place is packed at midnight so reservations are a good idea. Waiters aren't the friendliest, ambiance is okay, clean but no benihana. Like I said, if you're looking for a fancy Japonese restaurant... this isn't for you. Small only 2 teppan sections / 4 stove stations. Locals place, big on group events. They don't start taking your order till 12:20am, start teppan cooking till at least 12:45am so if you arrive at midnight, just plan on waiting, however if you don't come right at 12 or a little before, you may not get a seat. Sushi bar is open so share a roll and that'll tie you over. 1 hour 45 min later meal was finished. Chef was very nice and friendly, apologized for our long wait and the food was delicious. Shout out to the Island Boy Nick for being a great waiter.",1
"A.  Get a table.  Just spend the money, it's Vegas!\nB.  Throw some cash under the table to the bouncer.\nC.  Wait forever.\nD. Ditch the guys\n\nThose are your choices and there is no way around it.  I don't care how hot you are, if guys outnumber you in your party you will get the smack down.    Oh yeah and dress hot because that always increases your chances (show your body!).\n\nWhen we went we stood in the longest line ever, we couldn't even see the club door from where we started.  It was worse than Disneyland.  The people we were with weren't willing to drop money on a table (booooo) nor did they want to pay the bouncer.  Well guess what that makes us?  Just like every other group that's standing in line with a bunch of guys.  After forever and 92 days we gave up and went to Blush.   If you want to go here, be prepared. Either separate from the guys or be willing to pay.",1
"For Chinese takeaways Hong's is one of the best I've ever had.  It's fast, it's delicious and it's not too greasy. I love Hong's. I'd recommended: the shredded crispy chicken in chilli sauce, the satay chicken, the chicken wings (salt and pepper), ribs, the pad pad thai. Not only do they serve Chinese food but they also do Thai.  Hong's is also super affordable. Get a bunch of friends together and order a various things off the menu.  I guarantee Hong's won't disappoint!",1
"I have heard great things about this place from a friend of mine. When I read the previous review I was a bit worried that they were closed. I drove by today and they are open for business. Not sure what happened, but the place was busy and I decided to check it out.\n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch, and everything is home-made. Instead of a sandwich I decided to have the hummus and chicken breast.\n\nThere was plenty of food, making it well worth the price. The chicken was freshly grilled, juicy and flavorful. The hummus was wonderful. It also came with pita bread. It was all just a little too much to eat, actually.",1
"Great fast Chinese food like you would find in NYC - try it. Cheap & fresh, love this place.",1
"This show is amazing!!! Wow, Cirque really did this one right! This has to be my favorite Cirque show in Vegas.\n\nIt doesn't matter is you are a Beatles fan or not....you will have a good time at this one!   LOVE has a ton of energy.   Music (and I am really a Beatles fan) and audio is loud in a good way.  All the seats have their own speakers in the headrests.  \n\nBecause of the layout of the theater, you will not always be looking just straight ahead.  Things happen all around you and over your head.  Sit higher up in the sections to get a better view of everything.\n\nMay be a bit loud for the little ones and it does get really dark at points.",1
This place and the quality of the donuts is by far the best. Not enough places besides Dunkin and Krispy K. ( both are not my fav). This Winchells is ideal location right off the 95 at Eastern; small and clean and friendly help. Just north of the freeway. Had the urge to spoil the family on a Sunday morning. Was worth the drive from North Vegas. Will make a trip back soon.,1
"Stellar! One of my favorite places to eat in all of Phoenix. Sunday Happy Hour is rock solid - $5 small plates (many) and half price wine. \n\nThe menu covers everything you could want - steak, chicken, fish, sandwiches, veggies, etc... I have eaten a wide variety of items and have never been disappointed. \n\nYou should stop reading this and go there. Pony up to the bar and enjoy yourself.",1
"Awesome. One of the best IPAs I've ever had, and I've had a lot. Sandwiches are amazing and HUGE. Prices are more than reasonable for what you get. Good staff, knowledgable and attentive. When they say something is spicy, they mean it, but it's good as long as you can handle heat. Will make this a regular stop when I am in Pittsburgh.",1
"This is a pricey restaurant in a bougie hotel, but hey, what else would you expect? We picked it for a bachelorette party since we wanted a fancy dinner and it was close to Surrender, which was our destination afterward. Very nice, modern ambiance, and the perfect place for a classy dinner or date. \n\nThe menu offers interesting, upscale versions of your favorite comfort foods. I ordered the jumbo lump crab and asparagus salad, which I really, really enjoyed. The hearts of palm were a nice, unique addition. It was the perfect portion for a pre-going-out dinner, and very generous with the crab. For dessert, our party ordered the donut holes with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces, which were also delicious. \n\nService was outstanding. We had multiple servers for our large party, keeping our champagne glasses full, and all of them professional and hospitable above all standards. \n\nI do wish they had a bathroom in the restaurant... it's quite a walk to the casino restroom, especially in heels and after some bubbly. The food wasn't the most memorable I've ever had, but the great service made our experience special. I'd love to come back for the breakfast that everyone raves about.",1
"Sometimes a girl gets a wicked hankerin' for some chicken fried steak, mashed taters, and white gravy.  You know that what she does?  She goes to Texaz Grill.\n\nFor a ridiculously satisfying and heart clogging meal, you can't beat it.  It's got a casual and fun atmosphere, and it's extremely reasonably priced.  And best of all, the bar has a total honky tonk feel that makes me want to run home and play Urban Cowboy with the mister.",1
"This is SUCH a lovely place to have breakfast!! They get 5 stars based on their vanilla yogurt alone. It's deliciously creamy and it's filled with real vanilla bean seeds. Oh.my.goodness. And for a cup of this, priced the same as a glass of iced tea, it's a steal..\n\nMy husband said he's never had fresher tasting fruit in his fruit plate. \n\nThis place completely gets an A+ for their food. And while their prices are high, you are definitely getting your money's worth as far as quality of food and quality service. We went here a few times and really enjoyed ourselves.",1
The food here lived up to the hype. Great neighborhood vibe.  Walkup and order and then they serve you.  Not a place for dinner but any other time the place would be great.  Good music going also.  Highly recommend it as a stop.,1
"When it comes to chain delivery pizza, Hungry Howie's and Papa Johns take all. Hungry Howie's is good fast pizza. But realistically I think that it takes the cake because of the crust selections! \n\n-Original\n-Ranch\n-Cajun\n-Onion\n-Garlic Herb\n-Butter\n-Butter Cheese\n-Sesame.\n\nThe fact that you get to choose your crust is a genius concept and I would take Howies over Pizza Hut, Dominos, and most other big pizza chains.",1
"I have been coming here since 2008, and I have to say...it's all good, every time! The service is always friendly and outstanding, which goes miles with me...but add to that such a great, unique and tasty menu that non-vegetarians like me are swayed to eat veg. I mean, vegan po' boys, kung pao, coconut curry, garden burgers, meatball sandwiches--all of which are tastier than the so-called \""""real things\"""". I had the spicy bbq chicken sandwich with a side of curry pasta salad today, which rocked, and with a friend who hadn't been in yet, and who, I'm sure, will be back. May I also suggest the thyme fries, which are a bit of awesome. I don't care about the so-called \""""scenesters\"""" that one reviewer was complaining about. I like that they replaced the standard soda fountain with a lineup of kombucha, Izze, and other healthy drinks. I just eat happily and enjoy myself here, and notice that everyone else is generally doing exactly the same.\n\nGo Green!",1
"My team had a great dinner here one night. The atmosphere and the service were both extremely pleasant. \n\nThe meatballs that we shared as an appetizer were enough for 3 people to get a good taste. My toasted ravioli (a heavy dish, to be sure) was very filling and satisfying.",1
"Been here a few times with frat boys but I never catch a good night. I mean hey, I obviously make the best of it and enjoy myself but it's never quite as packed as I'd hope it to be. Usually I find myself looking around and knowing everyone in the room which isn't what you're always looking for on a night out. \n\nIt's a pleasure getting into Jackrabbit when you're with the right people and the bouncers have always treated me well. \n\nI remember going there last year after the Lupe Fiasco concert on a Thursday for my birthday and the bartender gave me a free drink.. or two ;)\n\nThe music's great and I've even been on stage shaking my booty here and there. \n\nThough I doubt you'll be checking out the decor of the place next time your there, do check the wall paper its cheesy but cool!",1
"= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR G'S BUFFET!  = = = = = =\n\nG's here has a daily HOT DOG BUFFET, & is it ever good!  All sorts of different kinds of hot dogs available, plus big selections of condiments, other hot foods & many side dishes.  I enjoyed a big Smoked Polish Dog, an Italian Sausage Dog, potato salad, cole slaw, mixed fruit, mixed steamed veggies, tasty onion rings, BBQ Chicken & more.\n\nHot Dog Buffet Monday through Thursday:  $8.95 including fountain beverage.\n\n*  For $10.95 they will make you a big sandwich too (but why?).\n\n*  For $14.95 on Friday & Saturday they put out more food items, soups, crab legs, shrimp, & prime rib as well as the hot dogs.\n\nIt's a big YAY! & a high 4 Stars for G's Hot Dog Buffet!     :-))",1
"If you want to get around the strip quickly this is the best route.  Taxis are expensive and take too long.  Walking (as I did this trip, SUX!)  I definitely enjoy the monorail to zip around town.  It is affordable for the all-day and 3-day passes.  However, I do suggest staying at a hotel on the strip or you will end up trying to hunt down parking just to get to the monorail, which happened to us this trip.",1
"What a wonderful dining experience we had at Le Cirque.  You are taken care of the moment you walk in the door.  The most attentive staff, delicious food, elegant and upscale decor.  My husband and I were quite impressed and would definitely go back for another go at some point in the future.\n\nThe meal started off with this delicious amuse bouche - a chilled corn chowder.  I didn't think I'd want to eat a cold soup, but this was divine.  First course was my absolute favorite.  Chose the seasonal risotto, which currently it was topped with shaved white truffle.  HEAVENLY.  The risotto was perfectly creamy, the truffle decadent and rich.  I wanted to eat it all, but knew I had more food coming and most definitely didn't want to get too full too fast.  Sadly I had to give them a 2/3 empty bowl back, and my heart literally broke.\n\nMy husband loooooooves foie gras, so I knew before he opened his mouth he was about to order the seared foie gras.  All he kept saying throughout the course was this was how foie gras was supposed to taste.  I'm pretty sure that meant he approved.\n\nSecond course was the Maine Lobster.  This came in the form of lobster tail, lobster cake and a couple of lobster claws.  Accompanied by a mushroom and squash side.  I didn't eat much of the side - not because it wasn't good but because it didn't excite me like the lobster did.  You know, saving room and all that.  The lobster cake was like a crab cake and was very savory.  I did like the tail, but I wasn't over the moon with it like I was the risotto.  But let's face it: how hard is it to top a 5-star risotto?  Very.\n\nHubby got the wagyu beef with bone marrow fondant.  We didn't talk much during this course.  He cleaned his plate.  That's enough evidence for me.\n\nLast course was the roasted pineapple/white chocolate mousse/mango sorbet thing.  It was the perfect ending.  Not too rich - the tart sweetness of the pineapple balanced out the creamy mousse.  An excellent blend of flavors.  My husband had the chocolate Grand Marnier souffle, which he thought was spectacular.\n\nSurprisingly, I didn't make myself miserable with food and walked away regretful that someone in the kitchen was in possession of the rest of my risotto.  Ah well.  It was definitely a meal to remember, that's for sure.",1
"my favorite indulgence.  The concretes are delicious.  Love the options and toppings. (although it can get slightly pricey when adding all of the toppings) Every employee I have seen has been very nice.  The other day I went through the drive through with my dog.  The employee working was so nice and chit chatted with me about dogs and then brought out a small doggie sized cone and asked if he could have it.  I really appreciate these little things that bring a smile to my face,  It keeps us coming back!",1
"I have lived in Montreal for several years and every time I come back to the city I do not miss the chance to go to 3 Brasseurs. I prefer this location (St. Catherine/McGill College) but have been to all of them (St. Denis one, Old Port, Crescent, Laval etc). I do not think there has been a single time in the maybe 20-30 visits minimum that I was ever disappointed. No joke. \n\nBeer is always excellent and they make their own. Any of them would do. My gf loves the beer cocktails they make she always has a few when we go. As for the food, I always love getting the Flammkueche (flatbread pizzas) which are incredible. Has other things as well, such as the chicken skewers, burgers or pork - and again never was disappointed. One thing that they could improve on is their poutine - not the top I've had in Quebec...\n\nAll in all - everytime I go to Montreal I must have some 3 Brasseurs - and everytime I leave a happy camper!",1
"There are several shared characteristics of a good dive bar:\n1. Cash only for cheap, stiff drinks.\n2. Pool tables (or alternately, shuffle board. darts must be combined with some other lure in order to count.)\n3. Jukebox (classic rock required, the top 40 laughed out of the place.)\n4. An air of disrepair (rips in the booth upholstery, musty smell of smoke on the air- because despite the ban, it's already been cured into the wood.)\n\nThis place has all those things in spades.\n\nI hardly ever end up at the Time Out Lounge because I never carry cash, but the drinks are deliciously strong and don't strip your wallet of its greenery too quick. There's an ATM there too. The pitchers and half pitchers are also pretty cheap, but if you're drinking by yourself, you're required to get the half pitcher. Apparently they can't serve you a drink the size of your head in one sitting. What wacky laws.\n\nThere are several pool tables that take up the majority of the space, but if you're going during the rush, good luck securing one of them. I'm not that great at pool, but I really enjoy playing at this place (usually with a good partner I can coast off of and then gloat with after we win) because of the atmosphere. So don't be a hater. \n\nThere's a dart board off to the side of the place in a raised area with a couch and a jukebox. My friend and I got our asses handed to us on a plate by a couple of British expatriates in a game of cricket. But tall dark and handsome can beat me any day. It's all about the accent. Surprisingly, I've never used the jukebox. But I have heard wonderful tales of it from multiple people.",1
"I love El Molinos!! Their breakfast burritos are my favorite! My definitely my go to place for mexican food and THEY DELIVER! Thats right Mexican food that delivers. The food is pretty authentic, which is rare to find in these neck of the woods. \n\nI wish I could of taken a pic of how the food is packaged for delivery. I mean everything is sealed, taped and packaged very nicely and professionally! No messes, no forgotten items, LEGIT PACKAGING! Which to me is a big deal means they really care how your food is delivered! \n\nAgain highly recommend this place for eat in or delivery! You guys rock!",1
"Simply awesome!  Definitely try the fresh made chips and guacamole as well as the tacos.  The Carne Asada Beef taco is amazing.  Margarita's were spot on.  The hotel that it is locate in is a little different, but don't let that scare you away.",1
"Great place to fix your glasses. Very friendly and genuine staff. My glasses screw fell off and the nice gentleman who helped me, fixed it in 5 minutes. 100% recommended.",1
"You cannot beat this hotel's accomodations and location for the price. I stayed for 3 nights at a rate of $41 per night. My room was clean and orderly. Television, internet connection, fridge worked. The rooms were fairly up to date.  I liked how they tried to be classy and equip the rooms with two mediocre bathrobes. I enjoyed the heated pool in the mornings, along with the bird chirping going on from the large bird cage nestled in the courtyard.",1
"My friend Tom told me to go there. I didn't think it was gonna be as good as he said it would be, but man Im hooked on this place. The flavor in the food is so unique. The menu has such great variety. I had the Chimichanga Monday, Tuesday, I had the Ribs which were very good. Friday, I had the Beef Medallion with Chipotle Pasta, my Dad had the meatloaf. Their food is incredible. Anyone who doesn't give this place at least 4 stars, has no credibility when it comes to food. It is a 5 in my book. Can't wait to go again soon.",1
"Only got take out from here. I will have to try dining in. The food was delicious and ready fast. We ordered lemon chicken, beef fried rice, and egg rolls. All of it was delicious and reasonably priced. Portions were big too so leftovers for lunch!",1
"Awesome staff, clean, modern furniture. Super comfy beds, immaculate decor. Huge rooms and bathrooms. The casino is pretty steep and you can't find any tables with $25 less minimum bets but I'm sure that's what you will get at all the high end hotels in Vegas. We stayed in a tower suite and were on the 9th floor. The view of the strip was viewable and the window was from floor to ceiling so it was nice once we got the drapes opened. Everything is electronic and you could put on all the lights and open all drapes at the push of a button! Bathroom came with a huge tub and separate tiled shower, two huge sinks with a vanity stool ideal for applying make up. I loved how the toilet was separated by a door so you could get ready while someone taking care of their own business! \nThe Wynn definitely meets all expectations for a 5 star hotel in Vegas, and would recommended anyone to stay here if you're willing to drop some bills.",1
"I have many pictures of my four legged kids, most not very good as I can never get them to sit still long enough to capture the 'who' it is that they are.  Christmas of last year, I decided I needed professional assistance and contacted Michelle Pelberg of Cow Dreamz  Photography, (602) 510-1929.  Michelle will meet prospective clients in most any setting as it is her mission to photograph pets relaxed and in their element.  We decided on a local park and met in the afternoon.  Like all great photographers, Michelle snapped away, remaining inconspicuous as my dogs enjoyed a winter day in the great out doors.\n\nI will utilize Michelle in any future pet photography project and happily endorse her services to all interested parties.  She has a knack for capturing the essence of our beloved four legged kids.",1
"The food is great! no doubt!  The resturant is pretty cool too.  My kids actually enjoy the place, and eat the food and they always get to pick their favorite candy when they are done from all the old fashion candies.  Every once and awhile their line gets backed up pretty far, but i guess most resturants have that problem on a Saturdays.  The problem could be fixed with a little rearranging of a few things but it isn't that big of a deal.  We will go back many times in the future.",1
"Wowza! Find peace and serenity in a crazy city. This place was my sanctuary during a hard summer in vegas. All the instructors were amazing. I lost 12 lbs from 172 to 160 over a month. It wasn't weight I needed to lose but that just shows the power of this great practice. I went 5x per week and saw Caitlin, Seashell, Patrick, Dominique, Yuko, and Lisa. I may have seen some others too, but all of them were super high, good energy and pumped us through class. I hope you enjoy the studio as much as I did!\n\nNamaste, Charlie",1
"Had lunch with my brother and sister here, we didn't have reservation but were seated shortly.\n\nService was 5 stars-\nEven when we didn't look much, we were still taken care of with 5 star treatment. The waitress was very nice and didn't hold it against us that we were not in our Sunday's best.\n\nFood 4 1/2 stars-\nWe ordered from the lunch menu, they had the 2 specials, my brother got the burger and sister went for the crab cakes. Both were great. I had the salad which was scrumptious too. We shared a petit four of desserts. Unbelievably moist chocolate cake, the other 3 were good too but I was too blown away by the chocolate cake that I can not imagine talking about them.  \n\nAmbiance 5 stars-\nWhilst you sit enjoying the food, the restaurant imperceptibly revolve, thus you are afforded a spectacular 360 view of Las Vegas. Every so often you witness some bad @$$ bungee jump off the side of the building. Talk about extreme!\n\nOne of a kind experience and only in Vegas!",1
"LARGE beer selection and cool beer program for frequent visitors, paired with good selection of pizza, and other pizza joint offerings.  I LOVE their deep dish pizza and love how they do have some crispy toppings from the oven as well.  Many TV's in the bar and quite a few out in the dining room as well.",1
"Walking around in Old Montreal, looking for a quiet place for drinks and snacks, we stumbled upon Petit Moulinsart.  They had a fantastic courtyard in the back that was perfect for sharing some wine, mussles and frites. \n\nWe ordered 3 half portions of mussles - tomato and corriander ($11), blue cheese ($13) and dijonnaise ($14).  Each order came with about 25-30 mussles which was enough to split between 5 ladies.  A small portion of salty frites came with each, as well as baguette for sopping up the delicious sauce.  We also got a bottle of red wine ($40).  \n\nA nice start to our weekend in Montreal.  Happy we found this charming place amongst the sea of tourist traps in the area.",1
"Ah.. Joe's.  I think this is home to perhaps the best meal I have ever had in Las Vegas.. second to Nobu.  \n\nI try to visit every time I am in Vegas.  Their service has always been great and the restaurant is a little brighter (ie less romatic) so it's great for casual dining.  They also have a seating area that extends out the front into the forum shops so you can people watch if you want.\n\nCrab claws are basically what they are known for but what makes me want to go back is the beef.  I always get a NY strip and it's always done to perfection.  Sides are great and perfect for sharing.  French fried sweets, roasted sweet corn, asparagus, it's all very tasty.  \n\nTheir banana cream pie is also a winner.  \n\nThe thing that sets this place above others though is the seasoning mix they give you to put on your steak.  It is quite simply the perfect blend of seasonings that bring out the flavor of your steak.\n\n5 Stars!!",1
"My husband and I came here on his lunch break, and was greeted right away, the Manager walked up and I asked what I was thinking about  getting and I told him that I ALWAYS get the smokehouse sub but wanted to try something different! He suggested a sub and I told him I'll just stick to the same sub so he offered to split his sub w me just so I can try it.... Wow!!! Now that's how u keep a customer coming back!!  Not to mention everyone is super nice always happy and if u enjoy trying different hot sauces they have over 25 different sauces!!!!",1
This place was a last minute thought on our Vegas excursion. This place is EXPENSIVE but so worth the cost. They have a great wine selection as well. To start we had their signature stone crab claws. The crab was served cold so threw me off a bit but when I tasted it boy was it AMAZING. Then the Steak we ordered was huge... So we ended up splitting it with some still left over. This literally melted in your mouth. Our server was adorable and so attentive to our table. We were seated in the front dining area. I wouldn't mind swinging by for a lunch or dinner here when I hit up Vegas again.,1
"Read rave reviews for the burger, so we tried it. Just ok, could have more flavor. Sweet potato fries were limp and soggy too. The wait was also really long, but it's more because it's a small restaurant I think. \n\nI guess it's sort of the only burger joint in Squirrel Hill, but I think i'd go somewhere else instead.",0
I expected to be treated better for the money that was spent. Customer service needs to improve.,0
"Slow service and occasionally rude people working. I know it's only McDonalds but what happened to pride in work, whatever that work may be.",0
"My fiance and I went to this location for dinner, our receipt lists the time as being 8:42 p.m. He had been to Red Robin a few times, but this was my first, and most likely my last. He hadn't had any problems the times he's been before, but everything about this visit was awful. First, we asked for a booth and we were sat way on the end by a door, and it was only a half booth, the other side were chairs... it felt a bit like being in a hallway. I used the restroom before we ordered, and it was not clean. There were two open stalls, one looked clogged, and the other one I used did not have toilet paper installed. Luckily, there was a wrapped roll elsewhere I grabbed first. One of the sinks was leaking and constantly running and there were paper towels overflowing all on the floor. When I got back we ordered water to drink, which tasted awful. By 2014, I would expect restaurants to know how important it is to people to have filtered water. Fries were brought to our table, but the server did not clear the empty tray, someone else did as they were walking by, and our \""""bottomless\"""" fries were not refilled. We ordered, and waited. The food seemed to take a long time for what it was, and our server again, was not the one to help us. Someone else brought out our food and our server was nowhere to be found for most of the evening. She did not check in on how the food was, and I had to wait a long time for her to walk by so I could flag her down with a question. I asked if I was served the kids meal of what I ordered - I ordered the battered chicken and shrimp - which came to the table looking dismal, and quite frankly ridiculous. I have a photo I will post. It is a giant plate of fries - as if they are the main part of the entree - and just a few small pieces of chicken and shrimp tossed on to the side as if they are the garnish. It looks laughable in the photo. When I asked if this was the kids meal, she said no it was the adult size, and did not offer to bring out anything else to make it more of a meal. Both my fiance and I were flabbergasted that you would charge $12.99 + tax and tip for this - it was overcooked, the shrimp were rubbery, and quite honestly, I could have bought this at the grocery store for wayyyy less money and made it better myself. My fiance's drink ran empty most of the night, as did his fries. We waited for our check to come, and the only time our server came back quickly to the table was to collect our money and her tip. Overall it was one of the worst eating-out experiences I've ever had... The chicken was half the size of the chicken strips at Applebee's, just an FYI, and they charge about half what you charge... they are double the size there and they serve it with three pieces.",0
"i really hate to do this, but i have to. service was slower than slow. my bagel + cream cheese was super skimpy on the cream cheese. turkey chili was lukewarm and not as good as it should have been. the staff seemed gloomy and sad. it just wasn't a good experience. it really is too bad, i haven't had lunch at a einstein's in forever and i was hoping it would be as good as i remember it.",0
"If I was teacher, I'd be the one that starts you off with 100% and you can keep it, or lose it.  There is nothing to earn.  I review similarly.  You start off with 5 stars, you keep them or lose them. \n\n-1 Star: The food was not delicious even by bar standards. I ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce. The breading was disgusting and flaking off.  My friend order the chicken tacos, which tasted good, but she ended up with food poisoning later in the day :(\n\n-1 Star: The service. As mentioned above I ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce. The server asked me what heat I wanted and I inquired, \""""How hot is hot?!\""""\n \""""OMG! Hot is really really hot!  I wouldn't recommend it\"""" \nSo I settled on the medium. Turns out we have different definitions of hot and when my chicken tenders with sauce on the side arrived I tasted nothing but bland chicken. Completely flavorless. I didn't want to be a huge ass and send my food back because the server was so completely off with her suggestion so I just asked for a side of hot sauce..........................let each of those periods represent a minute that went by without hot sauce and without acknowledgment. Finally she came by and I again asked about my hot sauce.  She rolled her eyes and kind of huffed something unintelligible (obviously inconvenienced) and started talking to the table next to us..........finally, after about 30 minutes between first requesting hot sauce and receiving, my cold chicken tenders received their compliment. Yes, the restaurant was busy, it was a typical AFC game day. Typical game day, much less busy than I've seen in 100 other sports bars, including ones I've worked at, so sympathic I am not. If your servers can't handle it, staff more on game days. How many people want a job these days? \n\n-1 Star: The bill. It is a sports bar with multiple games running all day and without prompting and still a half our beers left, our bill was brought to us. I would have easily done another round but with the amount of time everything was taking and the subtle hint to close out, we decided maybe we should take our business elsewhere. \n\n-1 Star: They changed our game to the pregame of another game which without sound, is pretty much was just 2 guys sitting at a desk talking on mute.  I get that this happens at sports bars and I thought the group of 5 guys next to us much have requested it.  Then I realized they were also pissed off about the channel change!  So, why unprompted (no other tables could see that tv) they change a live game to a pregame with no sound, I will never understand.\n\nSo we are down to 1 Star.  I would've have given zero if I could've.  The final insult to injury...\n\n-1 Star: Extra sauce charges. This is pretty trivial, which is why I don't understand, after waiting 30 minutes for wing sauce the waitress didn't comp the $.50. I know how the restaurant game works. You go to the kitchen and ask for a side of hot sauce, especially after you screwed up and took forever.  It does not have to go through the computer. $.50. I ended up being charged for 2 sauces, the medium, which I didn't touch and the hot, which took forever. I would've talked to the manager and got it comped but I decided to take it out of the tip instead...its all the same dollars and cents to me honey so upcharge all you want. \n\nI should say I've been to a bunch of other Zipps in Phoenix: Greenway, Via de Ventura, Indian School/36st, never had any issue. They are 3/4 star establishment, good places to drink beer, each average bar food and enjoy a game.   I don't know what it is about this Zipps--the management, staff training, complete lack of customer service. Never will go back.  If you aren't a regular you will have a TERRIBLE experience like I did. Drive the 4 miles to Greenway/64thSt or Via de Ventura, you'll be much better off.",0
"First time I went to this location and I am never going back.  I ordered two smoothies and one of them wasn't filled all the way compared to the other one (the other one was filled to the brim)!   It was like ordering two sandwiches and receiving one sandwich with half a bun.  I felt like I did not get my money's worth as there was a 2.5-inch waste of volume they could have filled.  Also,  I was careless enough to not check that they correctly stamped enough spots on the stamp card (gives you a free item after the ninth stamp).  They only gave me one stamp even though I ordered three items.  My fault for not correcting them.  However, I felt screwed over from just one visit.  Not coming back to this location.  The one on 215 and Jones is better.",0
"Oui, c'est vrai, tout est frais et de qualit\u00e9 ici mais une brioche aux pacanes + jus d'orange frais = 7,46$ !

Allez ailleurs !",0
"Not enough staff on Saturday to handle the crowd. The coffee containers were all empty, except one, and mislabeled. I got flavored coffee from the container, which wasn't labeled as such (which by the way, I hate). Other customers were leaving the restaurant very upset because their food was taking so long.",0
"We got seated quickly, waiter started off bringing the wrong drink for my son. VICTOR is the waiters name. He took our order so quickly but we wanted an appetizer since is was happy hour. But he took over 20 mins to come back and said it was past happy hour time. My sons food has refills on the fries and he told us it doesnt but menu says it does. Then he said is 99 cents and should of told him from the beginning  of the order. I will never eat here again if my server is VICTOR. This man needs to be fired. The ladys next to us complained to the Manager about him. Wow fire VICTOR",0
"I would have loved to give this restaurant a raving review, because it was aesthetically beautiful, and the waiter was friendly. However, I should note that I have celiac disease, and although I have safely ordered and eaten at several restaurants in the casinos, this was not one of them.\n\nI normally order by telling the server my restrictions, and asking how the food I choose is prepared. My meal was brought to me by someone other than my waiter. The meat came differently than described to me, and upon asking him what was in it, he told me cornstarch (I can't have corn). When my waiter came by, I asked him as well, and he agreed there was cornstarch. I told him I couldn't eat it, and he did not offer to take it away and replace it. He returned shortly after and said he checked with the chef, and said they were wrong, and there was no cornstarch. I had two bites of it, and decided it didn't seem safe. I ate the vegetables instead. I have spent the rest of my evening in awful pain from reacting to the food. If you are celiac, I don't recommend dining here.",0
"Honestly wish I could give it zero stars based on today... ? Security is beyond the worst. Check in with the airline was smooth, thats about it.\nI'm sure its not this bad everyday, or it would be on the news and or shutdown from the lack of business....",0
"Sheesh. This place was half empty today and they took an hour to bring me the wrong dish. Baked chicken on Caesar salad. The chicken was cooked very well, but the romaine lettuce was sloppy and old.",0

"I don't like Sushi, so I was doomed from the minute I walked through the door here.\n\nI asked the waiter what is the best thing to have for a first-time sushi experience,... he laughed in my face and told me I was in the wrong place.

"the pedicure was nice, I will give them that... but lady must have wanted 2 close shop early that day as I told her I wanted a pedi & an acrylic manicure when I first walked in. (She asked another customer to come back the next day while I was getting pedi). Needless to say, I didn't get my acrylic set, and towards the end, I could tell she was 1/2 arsing it... and they were a lil pricey... I mean, really, $5 for taking off my nail polish? I would give this place 1 star, but they did do a good job on the pedicure. not returning here...",0
"Did not care about it... This place is dark, extremely dark. I understand what they are trying to do, but you can't read the menus, literally. \nFood was hit and miss, more miss than hit. Way too much dressing/seasoning masking the actual taste of what you eat. They promote \""""family style\"""" but quantity can not replace quality.",0
The sangria here is awful. I think it was a tequila sunrise. The food is greasy and not in a good way. The only thing good was the goat cheese. But it is goat cheese. How can you mess that up?,0
"My biggest complaint about Treasure Island is the rank smell the downstairs casino has. It is very distinct. It made me sick each time we came downstairs and made us leave the hotel to shop and eat at other places. It was a mixture of suntan lotion, sweat, hot garbage, barf, and smoke. As soon as you walk in, it's there.\n\nEveryday by like 2:00 the pool would have a murky, creamy hue to it. This is due to people spraying on sunscreen while in the pool, or putting it on and getting right into the pool. Along with, I'm sure...pee. It was gross! I think they should close it for an hour mid-day to zap all the nastiness that is there by the afternoon. We only went in the mornings.\n\nThe buffet was just okay. We went during the crab leg night and they were sooo skinny, and had no flavor. They tasted like they were water logged.  The fried foods were soggy, and it seemed like we had gotten there when the food wasn't as fresh. We arrived before the line started forming. \n\nThe staff when we checked in and out were great! No complaints with the staff what so ever! However, the smell alone is enough to make me choose another hotel next time I'm there. I wish they could filter that out. It could just be the old carpet.",0
Pricy for the kind and selection of food that they have. They don't even have seaweed salad.  I'd rather go to Asian Buffet or Makino next time.  The only thing I like is the caramelizes sweet potato with sesame  seeds.  It took a long time to cook the meat by the temperature of the grill.  Service was okay!,0
"I've been going to Pita Jungle since it was a twee, one-room hovel on Apache, back when we had to walk uphill in the snow with no shoes for eight miles and shit. Seriously, I'm a long-time devotee. Back when I worked at that Planned Parenthood next door, it was 1000 Beans for lunch... every day. (Many apologies to my former co-workers and patients.)\n\nSo I've watched the gradual growth of PJ with some interest. Who doesn't want to see a locally-owned business thrive? When I saw the latest installment of the Great PJ Takeover occur in the form of a food court presence at Fashion Square, however, I have to admit I was somewhat befuddled. The dirty dreadlock crowd, attempting to permeate the premium-gas-only-SUV Louis Vuitton crowd? Doesn't this shit only happen in the movies?\n\nI've been to this location twice now, both times out of desperation - staunch refusal to eat excrement from Panda Express versus inability to maintain attention span long enough to wait in line at Paradise. I had a falafel salad that was just covered in the most rank and odiferous onions known to mankind. My second visit, I wised up and got the falafel sandwich-no-onions, which was wrapped in a half-reheated and totally dried out pita and covered in said devil onions. Now, mind you, lunch and a pop there will easily put you out $10. That's too much money to leave unsatisfied, with roaring heartburn and breath that would singe Satan's chest hair off.\n\nPlus, the people taking orders are impatient and a little snotty. Sorry if you've run out of patience trying to explain falafel to Middle America. Please don't take it out on everyone else.\n\nThree times may be a charm, but I don't think I'll be back to this location...",0
If I could give this place a negative star I would! I have been coming here for years the service is has done a nose dive in the ground!!!! The service has is HORRIBLE now ! Went there for take out when I got home the order was completely  wrong the one thing they did get right was cold! I called let them know what was my order was incorrect and went back to wait another 15 minutes for them to correct it. I told them that part of my order was COLD and they said they would not replace it because it was what I ordered and there  was nothing wrong with the food it was just cold.  The manger or what they hired as a manger said she could reheat my food  and to replace it would cost them money to replace it. I asked  for a refund and she was NOT going to give me my money back. Finally she went into the back and asked some other person what to do which he seemed to have so sort of customer service. He told her to give me a gift card for the amount of the of the food! What I am going to do with a gift card to a place I am not coming back to!!! When asked to speak with him she told me he was not the manger but yet he seemed to tell her what to do !  It's a shame I expect this type of service from a large chain but not from a small business  ! Sad to say but I will not be returning and I will be telling others so they don't get ripped off!,0
"Valet attendant Zach was terrible! We pulled up to fix an issue with our reservation, the entire valet was empty and he demanded that we show him our reservation email and then on top of it a tip to keep our vehicle in valet. He was so unfriendly and made our first impression of Mandalay bay a terrible one. Upon returning to the car I told him I thought he was rude and he said \""""ha! Ok\"""".. I told him I've lived here for 5 years and have never experienced such rude behavior from a valet attendant and he proceeded to look at me up and down and say \""""I've lived here my whole life, sorry honey\"""". I just was completely appalled. I have always loved Mandalay bay but have never felt so disrespected by a valet attendant.",0
"Our visit at this Arby's was a joke! The couple of clowns working around 8:00pm on 06/08/14, were as slow as snails and had the customer service skills of a piece of plywood. Seemed that there was one cook, one blonde girl cleaning the dining area, and a shift manager, named Jasmine. The shift manager continually stated \""""I'll be right with you\"""" again and again. At first, it was understandable, due to drive through orders, but then she just stopped and started talking to the blonde girl, giggling. When she finally got to us at the register, she was rude and unprofessional, sporting a look like we were inconveniencing her. After we gave her our order, she didn't bother to recite it back, but instead, gave me the total, swiped my card and slammed down the receipt with a pen and said, \""""I need you to sign this.\"""" $15/hr, eh? The food was great, but the service was insanely terrible and we will never go back.",0
"Steer clear from this poor excuse for a restaurant. I have dined at many restaurants, many Chinese restaurants that serve dim sum and this is the worst place I have been to. It starts with the water, want ice water? Great! It's straight from the tap and by tap, it's faucet water. The food? Like reheated bland food? Great! Everything not only looks reheated, it tastes reheated! Save your money, save your precious time and most of all, save yourself from bad Chinese food. Do not go here. Want great dim sum in Vegas? Then head to....well, anywhere else.",0
"So, this is probably the worst Nordstrom I have ever been too. And I have been to almost all on the west coast. It is not because of lack of product or prices. Nordstrom is about top products but, first it is about customer service. I have lived in Vegas for a year and have visited this store at least 20 times hoping for a \""""Nordstrom Experience\"""". Only once from Jeanette in Men's sportswear and my monthly shoe shines are the times I get good service. I am just at the very least looking at getting greated once I am seen in a department instead of having to wait for salespeople to quit conversing with each other. I am from the Seattle area and I have personal shoppers still to this day help me with products. I would rather gather sku's in Vegas and have them send me product from Seattle than to shop at this store. Because I know the salespeople there will still send me a thank card, tell me about events and say hi if I am in there department. At least earn your comission somewhat; I know people in shoes earn 8-10% commission and clothes earn 5-8% comission so please do something about the service here or reread your handbooks or even the book \""""Leave it Better than you Found it\"""" by Bruce Nordstrom. Oh thats right this is an internal book that must be being used as a doorstop there. \n\n@nordstrom",0
"We went to Mimi's because other times the food and service has been exceptional.  This time however the server was rude and seemed not to care about us at all!  She walked away abruptly before we had completely given her our order.  When my food arrived it was not correct.  Instead of offering to make it correct she argued with me about \""""that's always the way it comes out.\""""  When I mentioned to her that it was not what had been stated on the menu she said that she would have to get the manager.  By the time he came over we were half way through our meal.  A replacement meal for me meant that I would be eating alone and my family would be sitting there with nothing to do.  Another point of contention: As we were waiting for the waitress to come take our order we could hear the manager correcting her for something - loudly!  Very UN-professional to correct an employee where guests can hear.  It made us all very uncomfortable!  It will take quite a lot for me to consider going back to this Mimi's!  When a restaurant doesn't really take care of its guests it is a sure sign they don't want my money.  There are plenty of mediocre restaurants around - I want one that is great!",0
"I would love to love the Willow House.  I really want to, it's downtown and local.. I just can't.

I'm sorry Willow House, I really do want to love you, I just can't.",0
"This place was in the middle of renovations when I stayed in Vegas.  They charged my debit card a hundred dollars and my credit $300, instead of figuring a way to get that on my bosses card, as I was on a business trip.  The place was confusing and advertised restaurants were no longer in operation.  I liked my room fine and the little bar under the non smoking tower, but I found the service overall to be lackluster and nothing special.",0
"Everything on paper looks perfect.  We waited 45 minutes for a table that never came.  Called before I got there to make sure it wasn't too bad.  I was told to expect a 20 minute wait.  No biggie.  After a 45 minute wait, I was told another 30 were required.  Had tickets to Tosh so I had to leave.  Thank goodness for the magic speed the brothers from Los Dos Molinos put on their chile rellenos.  It was like they were crossing the Rio Grande all over again.  Screw SB1070,  I need mexican food anyways!\n\nFood may be good, but I'll never know now.",0
"This place is gross. I've been a few times with coworkers that love it, and have been disappointed every time. Every meal I've had has obviously been nuked in the microwave, with my most recent experience looking like they had accidentally put the pico on the plate BEFORE sticking it in the microwave, so it came out a steaming pile of tomato-ish sauce. If you do happen to do go this place, get something that has either been grilled or cooked fajita style...that's the only way you will be eating something that you'll know is relatively fresh.",0
Sat down this am. Waited almost 20 minutes. No one ever came to our table. We asked for service 3 times. Still no one. Very poor management. Won't go back.,0
"there's this commercial. order a medium or larger drink and get an egg and cheese english muffin for $.99. seemed like a good deal to me, and i was hungry this morning. besides, dunkin' has been making great strides in quality and service, right? that's what the marketing would have you believe anyway. so i order from the drive thru and pay $3.15 for a medium iced coffee and the aforementioned egg and cheese english muffin. service is swift. i drive away, ready to dig into my sandwich on the parking lot that is the 101. that's when things get ugly. my sandwich is cold. like, you can feel how cold it is through the paper bag. i can't eat it, mainly because i'm afraid it will sicken me in some way ... i don't screw around with egg. and yes, i'm still hungry. \n\nso, sorry dunkin', your marketing gal is a genius, but this store did not deliver. shame on me for believing that silly marketing ploy.",0
"Once in a while, it's possible that a restaurant can have a bad night. Like going on your first date with spinach on your front tooth. But three nights in a row is not a fluke; it's an art. \nMy first night, I ordered their Brooklyn Spaghetti and meatballs. Had I been a Brooklyn wise-guy, somebody would be missing a knee-cap.  They served it in a soup bowl, which was appropriate for the water in the bottom. The \""""garlic bread\"""" was subbed with some kind of flat bread with garlic butter on it.\nService was minimal, and the waiter must have been on his first week of employment-- Anywhere.\nSo I gave them another chance the next night, and ordered a sizzling platter. Served with a Filthy handle cover, and a rusty, or dirty knife.\nThird times a charm: Spaghetti again. Forgot the cheese. The white bread that was substituted for garlic toast, wasn't even toasted. The waiter said he was sorry, and he was right.\nCleanliness wasn't an option, or a concept known to them.\nSuffice to say it had  all the old world charm of Tijuana.",0
Does one have to give 1 star?  This is the worst Macdonalds in the Valley. Avoid it if you can.  Worst management & staff imaginable and all follows from that.,0
"This is not my typical Fry's, however I was nearby running errands and figured it would be convienent to stop here instead of going to my regular Fry's. \n\nThe layout seemed odd and not logical. The shelf for the sale item my mom was looking for was empty. So we asked an employee if they could check to see if there was any in the back. It looked like they were restocking at the time so the chances seemed good that there might be. We asked the first employee we saw and he pushed us off to another employee. She seemed annoyed by our presense but asked what we were looking for and said she would go look. She must have then pushed us off to someone else because about 5 minutes later some guy we hadn't seen before walked up and asked if we were looking for something as the girl we had previously talked to walked by. So we told him what we were looking for. He disappeared for quite a while. When we finally did see him again he seemed to be chatting and socializing with another worker. After watching that for a few minutes it was clear he was just hanging out and not looking for our item so we decided to buy the couple things we had and leave. Mom decided she would stop at another Fry's since getting help at this one was going nowhere. On our way out the last guy that helped us (I use that term very loosely) saw us and said they didn't have what we were looking for and that he tried to find us. Well we didn't feel like waiting unitl he was done with his social conversation. It's hard to believe they had so many employees working but we couldn't get a simple answer if they had one product in stock after waiiting about 15 minutes. \n\nNext time I will make sure I just go to my regular Fry's, even if it is slightly out of the way.",0
Never knew this was by the Eastern gym. Stopped in after the gym just to browse. This place is smaller than most rhapsodielle stores. I don't know if it was just the day I went but there was hardly any merchandise. It wasn't very clean and organized. \n\nYou can find really cheap clothes at Rhapsodielle but beware you do get what you pay for. The quality isn't as good but I have had clothes last forever from here. They do have a lot of cute stuff. If i just need a quick outfit I run down to rhapsodielle.,0
"I should have checked on here before visiting this place. If I could give them no stars I would too.\n\nI am sorry to say that this was by far the worst experience I have had dealing with anyone. I have dealt with some horrible used car salesmen before and this appliance place puts them all to shame. They have no common sense what so ever. They delivered a defective refrigerator and had the audacity to want to charge us 25% restocking fee when we requested to exchange it. I am appalled at their business practices and can not fathom how could someone let $35k worth of a sales fall through because they do not want to work with the customer and resolve some issues that in my opinion could have easily been rectified. Thanks to them we ended up going to Spencers and saved an additional $1200 because they were running a special when you buy a refrigerator, stove-top, and oven.",0

"I remember the Tin Angel of the 80s and 90s. There was a chef presence there at that time. Needless to say, its gone down hill ( no pun intended as it sits on Mt. Washington). \nWe went on a Saturday evening. Hardly anyone there but us and another party. The vast majority of tables empty. That should tell you something when the place used to be exceptionally busy.  First, unfriendly wait staff  should be replaced with eager enthusiastic servers. The wedding soup was the best tasting item on the menu.\nThe vegetable boat is something that is reminescent of an antipasta tray. It could use some sprucing up. The clam dip was ho hum and terribly runny. \nWe wanted veal but they were \""""out\"""" of it. Really? This is a city and you are a pricey restaurant with diners expecting a certain level of service on a saturday  evening. How can you not have access to veal. We were there at 6 pm and I saw no dinner rush so that would not explain it. So, we ordered Chicken and to say the least it was dissappointing. Desserts are glorified Costco cakes ( the chocolate one was a wad of Ganache). Truly this place is overpriced and obviously not on the radar of the foodie scene in Pittsburgh. My guess is that they have a few\nLine cooks back in the kitchen. Its sad because the intimate atmosphere could really be improved upon and the restaurant be very exclusive with a top notch chef. Its obvious the place will close its doors in the next few years without a major makeover from top to bottom.\nI hope they get their act together and improve the quality of their food. Until then, I will not be back.",0
"Can somebody please give me a tongue scraper??? Quick! The taste (or lack thereof) of the crappy $9 bloody mary is piercing my tongue! One of the things that irks me the most, is when you go to a restaurant, spend ten dollars on a \""""signature\"""" cocktail and it tastes like garbage. \n\nIn this case it tasted like water tomato juice, with a sprinkle of pepper. And a massive celery stick that engulfed the glass. \n\nSo you say, you should drink beer when you go to these places. You're right! But then don't put crappy drinks on the menu, just to fill up space. \n\nAll in all, we are in Scottsdale after all...there are a million places to go that have more to offer.. \n\n\nI left after the drink. You got me at \""""hello?\"""" No, not so much.",0
"I have been shopping at Target stores for many many years now, and this is by far the worst location I've ever had the displeasure of visiting!\n\nI usually only shop at the Target close to my house off of Flamingo and Grand Canyon.  But I was shopping there for a certain piece of workout gear and they didn't have my size in stock.  So I called this location and after getting juggled between multiple employees over a 10 minute period I finally got someone to confirm that they not only had my size, but they had plenty of them.  So I decided to make the 10 or so minute drive up to get the item.\n\nUpon arriving, I walk into what I would call one dirty, horribly unorganized store.  It looked like the carpet hadn't been vacuumed in a long ass time.  There are clothes just laying on the dirty floor off of the racks.  I am already not impressed with this place and it's only been 30 seconds.  I start walking to where I'm assuming the men's clothing section is.  I do a full circle and still haven't found it.  I finally see an employee and ask them where it is and they point behind a wall that I was figuring was the back of the store, but it's actually just some stupid divider.  \n\nI scan all the racks twice and not only do I not see my size that was promised was here, but they don't even have the item stocked.  Not even one ugly color in the wrong size.  They don't have shit!  So I track down another employee which took about 10 minutes and tell them that I called and was assured the item was here.  They look with me for a minute or so and say \""""Yeah, guess not\"""" and walk away.  \n\nSo needless to say this was a wasted trip!  A waste of gas and a waste of about an hour of my time.\n\nSo while I'm still a fan of Target in general...fuck this location!",0
totally terrible service. i've been to other buca locations in the bay area and i think i'll stick to that.\n\ni recommend getting the chicken marsala though. it's really good,0
"I have to use one star?\n\nI used to be a regular customer at Calistro California Bistro. We discovered this place one day because we wanted a new happy hour place. I love flatbreads and this place had (key word had) awesome flatbread.  Things have recently changed here and the flatbread is no longer made in house and it's not very good. It is plain and not nearly as flavorful as the previous version. \n\nThe service used to be awesome but now it isn't.  Maybe they just didn't want me to be a regular customer anymore. Who knows?\n\nOne night I ordered a burger that was not prepared to my liking. Simple fix = make a new one. Instead they cooked the existing one more and over cooked it. Any chef knows this will happen. Laziness always prevails. \n\nThe best part is the manager passively aggressively said \""""My burger was prepared the right way\"""" (as if I was the problem).  So I passively aggressively posted this review. \nThen the manager offers to make another one. I have already waited about 45 minutes at this point - why not continue to wait? Clearly I have nothing better to do. So I reluctantly agreed because I actually liked coming there. So after another 30 minutes I am presented with a burger.  It was the way I asked for it to be, the FIRST two times.  But I'm still not happy and since I had waited so long I wasn't even hungry anymore.  I could have gone to another restaurant, ordered and eaten by this point. \n\nMy question is who accommodates me for all of the time wasted waiting for food that should have been prepared the right way the first 2 times I asked? \nCalistro actually charged me for my burger, never once gave me a reason to come back, no apology for their gross inadequacies and laziness in the kitchen. Nothing.  Every other successful restaurant tries to make immediate amends while the customer is there. There should never be an instance where management should indicate to someone - that they are the problem, not the food preparation.   When that customer leaves and you do nothing this is what you end up with. Bad reviews. \nTake advice from the marketing gurus at Starbucks. You have a bad experience and the next drink is on them. Coupon in hand when you leave. No choice but to come back and how quickly do we forget the bad time.\n\n\nThe restaurant is in a tough location, they aren't very busy whenever I'm there. I would think they would want to keep regular customers (2-3 times a week) happy.  But I guess they really don't want me dining there anyway. I take service like this personally.",0
"Went at 2pm on a Thursday and they were closed. Sign on the window says open daily 10am to 11pm.

I don't think I'll be giving them another shot.",0
"I have to admit that I had no idea who Holly Madison was before seeing this show, but I had some clients who were dying to see it, so I bought the best seats that were still available which weren't VIP, but the next section up.  The seats were good even though they were one of the front rows on the second level.  \n\nThe dancing and choreography was ok, the singing was good, but I agree with all the other reviews that Holly was pretty much useless.  I would have thought this show was pretty good if I had seen it in Atlanta, GA, but it definitely was not up to Vegas standards.  Holly showed her boobs a couple of times and strutted back and forth across the stage a few times, but other than that, the show could have gone on without her.  If seeing Holly is your only reason for wanting to see this show, then you are going to be disappointed.\n\nOh, and the whole nursery rhyme theme with the boobs just didn't go together.  It was actually kind of creepy.  \n\nThe \""""audience\"""" member, Timber, was very talented.  He was a great actor and was pretty convincing as an audience member.  Then he did some rope tricks in the bathtub scene...that was cool.\n\nThe girl in green who plays Ms. Pete pretty much made me turn gay for about 6 minutes.  She was awesome.  (Although the third little piggy who danced to Brickhouse might have made me turn a little gay too.)\n\n\nAnd lest I forget, the milk scene was cool.  I will give them that.\n\nIt wasn't horrible...I was just disappointed in it for $111/ticket.  For $50/ticket it might have gotten a higher rating because my expectations would have been lower.  I would recommend seeing another Vegas show.",0

"Can we just talk about the bacon and cheese sandwiches here.\n\nUsually, when you order a cheese sandwich, you expect to receive cheese with your sandwich, right?\nWell, not here. Not at Nana's.\nAt Nana's they give you some sandwich with your cheese.\n\nThe slab of (apparently Kraft) cheese was almost thicker than my finger. It oozed out of the sides of the sandwich and malevolently crept onto my plastic plate, spreading its unnaturally orange goo wherever it touched. The other ingredients of the salad - bacon and salsa - seemed to hide in the bread, recoiling from the menace below.\n\nEating the sandwich, all I could taste was the cheese.\nThere was no bacon. There was no salsa.\nOnly cheese.\n\nI'm uploading a photo of the sandwich so you can see for yourself. It's truly a monstrosity.\n\nOther than the Sandwich from Cheesy Hell, the restaurant was awkwardly quiet, the airspace filled only by the ticking of the clock and the clicking of silverware on plastic as the restaurant's one other patron, an elderly man, picked at his salad.\nI didn't feel \""""welcome\"""" and the staff weren't \""""friendly\"""", as other reviews have raved. I felt like I was at a Western-decorated mortuary.\n\nAt least the apple pie was good.",0
"Went here for our anniversary, which lands on St. Patty's Day, so to avoid the mayhem of Guinness chugging, we ate in the Stone House rather than the Stable Grill. \n\nSadly, the best part of my meal was the warm muffins that they serve in lieu of rolls(that day it was Irish Oatmeal and Raisin). They were so moist and yummy...but then it just went down from there. I chose one of the three meals they offer for around $17 that comes with a cup of soup and a glass of wine--which I have to admit is a nice price. The soupwas good, but the salad I had him order so we could trade was SWIMMING in low-quality blue cheese dressing. My chicken and biscuits were disappointing as well. The biscuit was overdone, and the rest was an over salted gelatinous...thing. He liked his pretzel crusted fish(perch, I think), but we both agreed that the Parmesan potato(a wad of cheesy hash browns) was undercooked, and cool in the middle. Hm. We were both glad we didn't get any of the pricier entrees, in case the quality was on the same level. \n\nAfter our meal, we did go through the wine cave and tunnel to the Stable Grill and thought it would be a good place for drinks and apps. \n\nAll in all, not a place I'm going to be dropping my money at, though.",0
"wow! What a surprise this resto was for me. I have been to the Outback on Sunset and Green Valley and do not remember it to be anything like this one on So.Las Vegas Blvd.\nI had the burger topped with their 'bloomin onions' and fries as a side dish.\nMy friend had the ribeye and baked potato and a side salad.\nOur food came at a reasonable time.\nI noticed that both our dishes were inordinately shiny (translate to - greasy!) but I didnt think much of it. I didnt finish my burger (ate about a 3rd of it and boxed the rest) finished my fries and my friend polished off her plate.\nThen we had coffee and key lime pie.\nAfter dinner, we headed out to the mall to \""""walk off\"""" all that grease we had consumed.\nBut as soon as I left the restaurant, I felt my mouth dry up. Thirty minutes after shopping, my friend wanted to go get a long cold drink of soda and so did I.\nWe were both so very very thirsty.\nAfter much thought, we were thinking about what could have possibly triggered such voracious thirst in both of us.\nSodium.\nThat restaurant served our food laced with maximum doses of sodium. \nI realized, my body reacts to MSG, and that what happens to me - I get very thirsty and  a bit swollen. Sure enough~! \nI will never eat there again - ever! \nDont bring your kids there although I saw very many families with young ones gobbling up the food.\nThey put too much sodium, cook with way too much grease.\nSodium is used as a preservative. I hoped I wasnt eating week old ground meat. Or worse(!) below standard quality ground beef.\nAll I can tell you is that, the following day - I got the runs,\nEat at your own risk!",0
"I wouldnt recommend this place for vegetarians, as they have zilch, excpet for pancakes, toast, omlette and stuff, for which I can go to ihop next door to me. The omelettes for vegetarians doesnt make the cut for me as on top of not having too many options for vegetarians, they charge much for every single topping on it. \nThe place isnt as big as the name suggests ;) but I love places like that which remind of an old house converted into an eatery. dont get me wrong, but the place is too small, but is super popular in circles, so expect a long wait time, we waited for 30 mins for 2 PM on a Tuesday. \nBut the price suits well for the Big in the name, the servings arent as big though as the name suggests. I like the build of the place, but I am not going here again.",0
"This is the place for the volume feed. As others have said, the portions are large if not downright scary. Moving beyond portion size, however, HH is not as big on flavor. \n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles-- the chicken (with the requisite sprig of rosemary) was crisp and moist, but rather bland. The belgian waffles had large pieces of bacon mixed into the batter and thus cooked into the waffle. Sadly, all I could taste was bacon. The 'maple reduction' drizzled around the waffle reminded me of a balsamic reduction and didn't really help. A side of syrup perked it up, but overall, hard to say it is worth ~$14. \n\nMy cousin had the corned beef hash- big pieces of corned beef but otherwise just as bland as my food. He say the (pizza-sized) flapjacks are better, so I may give it a try.  \n\nOverall, I think HH would be great if they can improve upon their flavors. Once over the novelty of big food, they need flavors to back them up.",0

"Tried this place because I had a groupon and I'm a huge fan of sushi. The service was excellent but the food, not so much. Sushi didn't seem fresh. Maybe they use frozen fish? The rolls definitely weren't made well and kept falling apart as I would try to pick it up. I then ordered the teriyaki chicken as the sushi was almost inedible. The fried rice was the best part of this dish. Either the teriyaki sauce had zero flavor or they forgot to put it on there. The dish was filled mostly with carrots and broccoli with little meat. Definitely not worth the price. Good thing I had a groupon. Won't be back again.",0
"I stopped for a breakfast due to my flight being delayed.\n\nThe cappuccino was acceptable, as was the table service.\n\nI ordered the breakfast burger, made with Scottish beef, bacon (English style), and a \""""fried\"""" egg.

"This place is the worst.\n\nI went around ten on Saturday night and it was packed.  It seems the place is intended to cater to rapey, Nickelback-loving, popped-collar misogynists and the women who love them.  \n\nThere is no place to sit, no place to talk (because it is LOUD) and zero ambience.  To its credit, though, I was served quickly (because there were like 3000 bartenders) and it wasn't that expensive, but it would take much, much more than that for me to ever return to rape-central again.",0
"I took my cat in for a second opinion not realizing she would leave in a box ! I went in on an emergency basis so when hydration was offered I put her in the hospital, I should have and would have taken her home If I had been told she was terminal.

"So I ordered the Nathan sliders as an appetizer. The menu specifically states that you get 6 mini hotdogs with your choice of topping. It lists cheese, relish, mustard and a few other things. I asked our server if it was nacho cheese or shredded cheese. She said either or. As I go to pay the tab says $1.99 for cheese added to our hotdogs. I explain to the check out lady that it was a mistake the menu says includes. She then has to go speak to her manager. She comes back and tells me she cannot remove it, it included a shredded cheese not a nacho cheese. Not only does the menu not state what type of cheese but the server didn't even specify. Most would just roll over because it's only $2 but I was in a feisty mood so I continued to argue. Finally a manager comes over and TELLS me not explains to me why it's an up charge. I TELL her back that it is crap they should be specific and our server said it was fine. 10 minutes later she took the sliders off all together. I wasn't asking for that just the $2 so that is why they get a 1 star. After all that I go to pay and she asks me how everything was....... \""""Actually it wasn't even that good\"""" was my answer.

"I've reviewed this before and I've been here right times.  I won't go back and I will stop recommending this place.  For many reasons.  \n\nThey charge 18% gratuity on parties of 5 or more.  We were six and the service was horrible.  She saw us twice. Once for order and once to give us the check.  No refills. No checking. Nothing.   We were going to tip 10% and to our amazement it was mandatory 18%.  I called the manager.  He came over and I told him the issue and to remove the 18%. Instead of apologizing, he put the blame back on us and said we should have asked for him.  Bottom line - we were blamed by the manager and the blame is put back on us. It shows issues not just by staff but by management. I said no and we would just walk out. He reluctantly removed the 18% and dropped the check back on our table. NO APOLOGY.  \n\nThe steak was overcooked for most of us. The mean was so so this time.  Its just a disappointment and there are tons of other options so I highly recommend if you are a party of 5 or more - be careful.  \n\nThe place is very dark too - hard to read menus and the chairs are wicker and uncomfortable- mostly to make the tables turn quicker.   It's obviously about the money there rather than service.  Go elsewhere.\n\nI got the impression she was mad they sat a party of 6 at an 8 table.  We didn't want wine because we already drank and I thought she felt we weren't a big value table.  So figured she got 18% automatically and that was enough.  It wasn't crowded.  Amazed she never checked with us.   For a restaurant to make 18% mandatory for 5 or more shows they have service issues.   Usually it's 6 or 8.",0

Pork tamales tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in them.  Pork taco was cold and pretty light on the meat.  The cheese enchiladas were, um, cheesy.  That's about it.  Not much taste at all.  Refried beans were smoky and not horrible.  But the rice, was the worst Mexican/Spanish rice I have ever put in my mouth.  Terrible!!  The only reason this place doesn't get one star is because our server, Boone, was awesome.  It's not his fault the food stank.

She grabbed the red velvet roughly- leaving a FINGERPRINT in the frosting and stuffed it into the box. I asked to see a manager, again with manager went back and forth. I ended up leaving with the 4 cupcakes and had to dump the one with a FINGERPRINT in the frosting in the garbage!!!!\n      I called a few days later and spoke to the OWNER. During our 10 minute conversation I never got a single apology about the situation I had to endure, I got excuses about new employees and I got numbers thrown at me about how much the shop makes and how many hotels use them and how great they are. Never once did the owner offer a solution to the situation or an apology. Over and over he talked about how great their shop was and how everyone in Vegas loves them.  I actually ended up hanging up on the owner during his 2nd or 3rd time telling me about how successful their business is and how wonderful their cupcakes are. HOWEVER- IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR REVIEWS....they are FAR from 5-star, so obviously not everyone loves them. And now I am another who does not love them.      \n        If you want an average cupcake and a sub-par experience in their shop choosing your flavors...a possible finger in your product and rude owners telling you how great they are and that their new employees just need more experience...enjoy GiGi's....otherwise, I highly reccomend ANY of their competitors for a better cupcake and a SUPERIER EXPERIENCE!",0
"I hate to give any Pita Jungle 1 star, I loooooooooove pita jungle!  But this place deserves it. \n\nI went here last Saturday with my sister and a friend. \n\nOur waitress was quick to take our drink order. At that time we placed an order for some hummus to snack on while we waited as they were super busy. Our drinks were delivered, but no hummus...we figure it will be out any moment....10 minutes go by and some other person comes to our table with our lunch order sans hummus...The waitress shows up and we ask if we could still have the hummus we ordered, she acted as if we just asked her to do something out side of her job description. Then my sister and I dig into our food, we both ordered the same exact thing and we both asked for chicken in our salads, neither of our salads had chicken. When we brought this to our waitresses attention she got all mad and huffed and puffed and we just told her to make sure we didn't get charged for the chicken as we didn't receive it. \n\nShe really sucked. Every time she came to our table she acted like a big bitch. \n\nThe waitress that was waiting on the section next to us was dressed in an outfit that was so ridiculous. Tank top, cowboy boots and shorts that were SO SHORT you could seriously almost see her lady parts. \n\nThis is not an over exaggeration, I don't even own bathing suits that short. This chick could have hit up the beach for a tan and not gotten any tan lines, that's how short these shorts were. She was barley covered and I was thankful she was not our waitress as I didn't want any rouge hairs in my meal. I can not believe that the PJ allows their wait staff to dress however they want with out any set reasonable guidelines. \n\nTHe food was awesome, the experience...not so much.",0
"Wally world a necessary evil.  it has low prices and pretty much everything you need. Customer service is hit and miss, it's rare to find a cashier that looks happy to be there. However there is a young man in electronics who always goes above and beyond. The store is open 24/7 so if you work late you can still go shopping.",0
"Given all the yogurt places in today's market, the flavor quality here does not impress.",0
"A very nice traditional French bistro. We went for breakfast with our friend Alan, who has been coming here for over 20 years. \nOwned by the same family for nearly 60 years, the food and the atmosphere was very nice. We ate outside on the terrace which was landscaped beautifully with ivy and flowers. \nThe service was terrible here. We had to ask twice for coffee refills, water, and even silverware. The wait staff seemed preoccupied.\nThe menu was traditional French. I had a country dried ham baguette sandwich which was very nice. Denis had the omelette. Again the food was great, service lacking.",0
"One to two stars, got the Jambalaya:\n\nMarinated chicken, white rice, andouille sausage, sweet peppers and roasted green onions in a spicy traditional jambalaya sauce\n\nWasn't:\nSpicy\nEvenly Heated\n\nHad:\nDelicious sauce\nA lot of Rice\n\n*Even BJs has a better Jambalaya with more stuff.\n\nWaiter was nice, split all the checks for us, she asked. (A party of 12)",0
Awful. We booked a flight and hotel and shuttle package and when we arrived at the door for the shuttle it was chaos. People standing everywhere and not knowing which line to go in. We waited for 45 minutes in line until a shuttle finally came. Our driver was way quicker and more efficient than the other drivers we saw but the showtime tours organization was a complete cluster. Wish there were more options at the airport that were quicker and reasonably priced.,0
"I may not ever come back-\nAll I could think of was \""""It took me a damn hour to find parking\"""" and \""""I wanna hit someone,anyone.\"""" This may be just as big of collection of douchbags as the strip on NYE. I felt sorry for all the artists down there, trying to make a living,when all the people who go there are just there to drink, people watch, and party. I didn't witness one person making a sale, and thievery MUST be incredible to fend off there.\n\nTo kick off the night, we thought we'd be able to park at the stratosphere and catch the tram,like the website says all over it. The valet was nice enough to come out and inform us otherwise.\nSo we drove down there at about 8,found parking at 9, stayed maybe an hour,wading through a bunch of drunks, and finally left after being way less than impressed. It's a damn good thing it's free, because I WOULD have hit someone after spending money just to get in that mess.",0
Have to say this location totally dropped the ball on Launch day of the iPhone 6.  Stood in line for 7 hours and never once did any of the employees follow apples policy on this launch day.  They said their system was down but never once did they come out with the cards needless to say I didn't get my iPhone 6 plus would of been nice to know this maybe after an hour after open not 6 hours later.   I will never show up for a launch day at this location ever again.  Ive never seen customer service this bad especially at apple.  If I didn't hate android so much this would've been my breaking point.  For now Ill just drive a little farther and visit another store in the valley.,0
"**Warning** Do not order the cooked food here except for burgers and pizzas. It is not edible!! I ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta, a shrimp scampi and their potato soup. Words cannot describe how awful they all were.... I sent back both of these entrees in exchange for a turkey sandwich  for lunch. I gave them two chances but I had to send back my food twice.\n\nThe Cheesecake factory in Riverside, NJ is waaaaaay better!",0
"The good news: You can save $10 per ticket by pre-purchasing online.\n\nThe bad news: You will wait one hour for each ride.\n\nI took my adult sons here for a day of birthday fun and we were so terribly disappointed. The ride lines were long and so slooooow. Everyone was complaining. I just can't understand how Disney can get this right but no one else seems to be able to. PEOPLE AT WET & WILD: hire an efficiency expert to fix this problem. \n\nOh yeah, and you need more of those 4-people rafts. Half the waiting was because you didn't have enough of them.\n\nWhen families spend this kind of money to go to the water park, they want to have fun. Not wait. Yes, there is a fast-pass you can buy for ANOTHER $20, but I saw those people waiting, too.\n\nAnother nit...a bottle of water is $3.99. And a double scoop of Thrifty (ha) ice cream cost me $5.00.\n\nReally, truly disappointing. I won't be back.",0
"This used to be my go to Chipotle, compared to the one at Alma cause their rice was always undercooked. But I might head back there now cause like stated before on other reviews, the portions SUCK! The amount of food they give: whether it's rice, meat, salsa, etc., its all VERY LITTLE. not to mention the workers there are never happy. Never. Again.",0
"Not kid friendly! We arrived around 5 pm, knowing that we did not have a RSVP and expecting a little wait. Upon arriving with our 12 year old daughter the Host stated it would be a little wait. There were 3 more groups of adults that were sat without a RSVP prior to the Host telling us they could not serve us and we had to leave. I have eaten there plenty of times, the food is poor and over priced by sitting by the water is what we go for. That being said go to Garfields next door. Way nicer employees, better food and kid friendly!",0
"A cool place to chill, relax with friends and have a drink or three on a Friday night but the food left a little bit to be desired. I Ordered the Fish Tacos (Being From Southern California I've eaten my share of both good and bad), when the arrived I noticed that the portion was good, the presentation was visually appealing with three tacos stacked atop mixed greens with a side of what LOOKED like mango salsa and a smal bucket of still warm, fresh cut potato chips. On 1st bit I noted that the texture was good, nice crunchy greens, warm soft tortillia and fish that....wait...where was the fish? There seemed to be a lack of fish, so I opened up all three and noticed that there was VERY little fish served with a GOOD bit of roughage and some sort of pinkish sauce that had the look and texture of 1000 Island dressing....Where was the Beloved white sauce and light, flaky fish that MAKES this dish a HIT? So If you are looking for a cool place to hang out and have a drink no problem, if your looking for tasty, authentic fish tacos...you've come to the wrong place. (I WILL say that the burgers, onion rings and hot wings LOOKED pretty damned authentic and tasty)",0
"I should preface this by saying I'm a bit of a hotel snob. Maybe not \""""snob\"""", but due to work I've honestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels, which is more than most people. I've had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests, and I've had lousy stays at expensive places because they don't do these things. Aria falls somewhere in between.\n\nActually no, Aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nThe non-hotel parts are great. The restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected, the casino is lovely, the shops are overpriced as expected, etc. If I didn't actually stay there, I probably would have given it 4 stars.\n\nHowever, the room quality was lousy. First off, there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room. Really? Tape or glue would solve that until it could be properly fixed. I'm shocked that a hotel would allow that to be in the guests' sight, especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.\n\nThe room itself was \""""meh\"""" at best. The bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke, and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago. It's a slow, laggy system with a lousy user interface, and it's completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the TV or turning the lights on or off. Unfortunately I was stuck using it to change the TV channels because the remote was dead. Speaking of dead, so was the minibar. It was maybe a few degrees below room temperature at the most. If you're going to use convenience to tempt me with soda, sparkling water, and various alcohols at 500% of retail, they at least need to be nice and cold.\n\nI ordered room service exactly once and the food was absolutely lousy. I would have thought they could manage a decent bowl of ramen (there are world-class ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel, so people around here should know what it's supposed to taste like) and it was beyond disappointing.\n\nThe kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didn't cost me a dime. Corporate expense account for the lot of it. Had I been actually paying to stay here, I would have checked out within a couple hours of check-in. I can literally say it's barely worth staying here for free. It seems like if you want to drop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience, but after this initial experience I'm not going to give them the chance when I come back for pleasure instead of business.\n\nTo be fair, the Aria did stand out for me in one area, and one area alone: the staff. Everyone I interacted with, from the front desk to the waitstaff to housekeeping to the valets, concierge, casino staff, convention area staff, etc. were all pleasant and professional. The staff are the only reason why this place gets a generous two stars instead of one.",0
Been trying for 30 mins on and off to order a delivery. I get voice mail and nothing else.,0
"On a recent visit to Las Vegas, I visited this restaurant for lunch. Although, I wanted to enjoy the food and ambiance, I was thoroughly disappointed. The salad bar spread was limited and not as fresh as I've experienced in other Brazilian restaurants. Furthermore, the meats offered were limited and the beef offerings overcooked. Needless to say, I won't be visiting this place the next time I'm in town.\n\nOn a positive note, the restaurant was clean, service was good, and the staff was friendly. Lunch prices were decent considering the spread offered.",0
"This place charges a cover fee. When we brought it up to the owner, they said a lot of places do it and that it covers for utensils, cleaning off the tables and Togo containers. I go to tons of dim sum and I've never heard of this! Then he said it was for the hot tea or water that they bring. I was never offered hot tea! This is a joke!",0
"We would NEVER stay at \""""Encore\"""" again!  The rooms were not overly luxurious (for the price we expected much more!), we didn't find ANY restaurant (including Allegro, the Buffet) that was even GOOD - let alone EXCELLENT - and all were way, way, way overpriced!  Drinks at the pool were watered down and $20/each!  Waitress service at the pool was S.....L,,,,,,O,,,,,,,W!!!!  AND, when we complained all we got was \""""sorry.\""""  NOT. GOOD. ENOUGH!",0
"If I could give Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo Cantina zero stars I would. (also his music!) \n\nWe arrived, party of two, at 10 pm. We asked to be seated inside, but valuing our hearing, we asked to move outside. Our waitress was angry and rude that we wanted to move. She took our order but refused to seat us outside. When we got outside we were ignored by EVERY EMPLOYEE FOR OVER AN HOUR. They refused to acknowledge me waving or attempting to flag them down. Our waitress was inside and outside helping OTHER people and flirting with the bar staff. After over an hour and no explanation or attention we left. We were NEVER SERVED OUR FOOD. This place is the worst. So glad I don't live in LV because otherwise I would demand repayment of my valuable time. Horrible place. Just horrible.\n\nThe one star is for the single (never refilled) glasses of water we were given. We never got anything else.",0
"We have been going to this office for the past 5 years with no issues.  During my children's last visit, we received a new dentist.  The dentist never introduced himself nor did he give any detailed explanation other than both of my children had cavities and that my 10yr old need to be put to sleep in order to have them filled.  When our visit had ended and the dentist started to walk away, I stopped him and stated I still had questions.  I wanted to know if my son need to see an orthodontist for his overbite, to which he said yes it was probably a good idea since many of his permanent teeth came in.  I felt that is something he should have mentioned to me instead of me inquiring.  Upon leaving I was asked to schedule an appointment and received estimates for both children to have their cavities filled.  The total for both children was close to $600 out of pocket.  I was so dissatisfied that I decided to have the services performed somewhere else.\n\nI scheduled services at another office for a check-up. That dentist showed me their x-rays and stated they had no cavities.  Upon exanimating my son's teeth, he stated that one of his molars formed a hole that need to be filled to prevent a future cavity.  The hole was not a cavity but the way the tooth had grew.  The new office was exceptional by comparison, very informative and caring.",0
"Clearly comfortable with their location.  The presentation was 3 stars, the food was 2 stars, the price was 6 stars.  The soup was weak and for $15 a bowl...you have to at least get that right.  I would not recommend this restaurant.",0
"Crackers & Co is a 4.5 only if we're on a 10-point scale.  I went with a party of four and we were all very underwhelmed with the slop served here.  Maybe we went on a bad day, but our disappointment went as far as the quality of the ingredients, which isn't something that typically varies on a day-to-day basis.  \n\nNow, TC Eggington's is a decent breakfast spot.  I can go there and count on a nicely prepared eggs benedict dish every time.  Crackers is not the type of place that would be capable of making a decent Hollandaise or even poaching an egg properly. \n\nI wouldn't be quite so hard on this place if their rating wasn't so outrageous.  I want to help others avoid going here with high hopes of an outstanding breakfast and come away with a belly full of unmemorable food.  What has happened to our standards for a good traditional American breakfast?",0
"Old, dirty, unfriendly, unaccomadating. Never again, EVER! When we arrived for check in at 3:30 on Thursday we were told by a Michelle G, who checked us in, that there were were no longer any king size bedrooms available, which is what we had reserved. This left me to wonder whether the guests waiting in the gigantic and growing line behind me were going to be told the same thing and how pissed everyone was going to be, right? My husband asked how that was possible and the chick had the audacity to tell us that technically check is 3 but no one is guaranteed their room until 6 pm!! Seriously?! Then why isn't check in at 6?! That was ridiculous. She must've thought we were stupid or something. She treated us like second class citizens and this really disappointed me. Well after my husband refused to budge, she made a call and magically found a king size bedroom available. She took no responsibility, made no apologies and frankly looked mad at us for some reason! Talk about quality customer service, what a joke! Well she must have had some sort of beef with us because the room we got was awful! Ugly, drab, old and equivalent to a crappy holiday inn, even then that may be an insult to the holiday inn. The bathroom had mold and hard water stains, and small.  The furniture was chipped and dis colored and carpet was old. Mind you we're not pretentious or picky but even this was pretty bad for vegas! We called to complain but the hotel refused to take responsibility and said they'd call back to switch our rooms and never did. When we met up at our friend's room I noticed their room was bigger and newer and a tad better but even they weren't happy with their room. Never again will we make the mistake of staying here. The Monte Carlo claim that \""""luxury should make you feel special no matter who you are\"""" and that was a bunch of BS. I should've just stuck with the Mandalay bay or Luxor. Sorry for grammar and punctuation, I'm on my phone and mad!",0
"When dining at the Bellagio, I'm aiming for a 4 or 5 star experience.  This was way below expectations! The service was extremely spotty.  \nWe had a large party, and I do understand if certain mistakes are made during busy hours.  However, they weren't super crowded.  Took a while for everything to come out.  What I really disliked the most was the waiter dropping off everything at certain spots of the table.  If you're a fancy sushi restaurant, wouldn't you at least know or remember who ordered which food and where it went? Also, there was clearly timing issues, and dishes came out one or two at a time.  For a large party, some people had to watch others eat.  It just amazed me how they dropped off the food, and since we were a large party, it took a while to determine who had ordered it.... And the waiter was pretty clueless also! The food itself was pricy, yet it was decent. The edamame was good, as it was well seasoned.  Besides that, definitely not worth it.  I would only go here again if I was forced to... If not, definitely visit other sushi places on the strip!!",0
"This place is supposed to come every 6 weeks to groom my dog.  Since April, they have shown up twice.  There was no explanation for the lapses.  Additionally, every time the groomer came, she was late for the appointment.  They charged $75 for my lab/chow mix.  A local grooming shop I found is great and only charged $45 for a better job.",0
