8367,Each delay has listed a new departure time so close that it clearly is a lie. We would have to be boarding now to hit 9:15 @AmericanAir
8368,@united 4 flights are leaving from LAX to SFO while I wait for my delayed flight to take off. So why do I keep flying with United?
8386,@united UA4815 delayed 3 hours because of maintenance. Please fix.
8391,Waiting for @united bags at @flySFO might be longer than the flight.
8433,@aureylian @united Wut.......... I'm lost.
8434,"@united if you have a crew availability issue the night before a flight, fix it instead of delaying the flight. http://t.co/G0a0oVKoIk"

8495,@VirginAmerica I'm trying to not panic but flight delayed out of Boston and it's cutting into my intl connection!! 90 minutes now 60...
8540,@Delta @DeltaAssist Delta strikes out again. Sky lounge at the country's busiest airport closed on weekends. Dumb &amp; cheap. miss you @united

9093,"@united Charged me $350 for not taking a United Flight, horrible customer service policies as usual"

9149,@AmericanAir landed over an hour ago at #Sfo and still waiting on my luggage.
9190,Great flight with @JetBlue  .. Unfortunately unbelievably long line at Terminal 5 for cabs.  In all my flying I've never seen it like that!

9352,@AmericanAir Gma died sun so I fly today w/ funeral Tue as a poor student your phone agents where nasty &amp; beat ticket price was $1600 (1/2)
9363,@united let people see if their bags fit - nothing is more angering than 3 empty overhead bins and your bag is under the plane - wasted time
9390,@Delta @DeltaAssist Was never told that booking my flight via telephone would result in a $27 (CAN) surcharge. #FlyDelta
9458,Insane lines at the @JetBlue  Terminal C checkpoint today. TSA guy sounds annoyed.
9462,@jtannerthanyou @AmericanAir is THE worst! That's why I only fly @united! #premier #mileageplus #mileageplusexplorer
9475,@DeltaAssist @Delta it's an abuse to keep travelers for 1hr in a plane without taking off! #shame
9478,@DeltaAssist Nothing like paying for first class and having disgusting seats.

12041,I HATE YOU @SouthwestAir
12081,@SouthwestAir our flight 4232 to MCO from MDW keeps getting pushed back. If it's going to be cancelled I'd like to know soon!
12083,@samkottler This is why I almost never fly @united any more. Too much bullshit. :/
12090,@DeltaAssist putting a customer on hold because you don't want to deal with their issue and waiting for them to go away is disgusting.
12105,So @SouthwestAir delayed out flight 2 hours from Midway. Then 45 minutes before decided to move it back on-time. Makes no sense.
12191,@DeltaAssist - still waiting for F/U to complaint. Yet unsurprised by delay. This is apparently what @Delta does best.
12227,"After waiting all day at Chicago Midway, I'm now at the mercy of @SouthwestAir staff to empty the lavatory so we can push off. Crappy day?"

12305,@united Help! What is happening? We're told our flight was cancelled but have no other info. On hold for 3 hours! What?!? This is the WORST.

12799,@united I'd be your best friend if you told them to hold the DEN-&gt;LAX flight tonight at 1012pm. I'm coming from IND now and delayed til 1027
12850,@SouthwestAir WORST attitude from your flight attendants on an already miserable travel experience! You should be shut down!! Never again!
12855,Will never fly @united airlines again. Past few times there is nothing but issues &amp; now stuck in Denver for the night #UnitedAirlines
12874,@VirginAmerica is probably the worst airline company ever. Delay on both flights... its time to think about compensation. #neveragain
12966,@DeltaAssist having issues with upgrades showing on flight is this a bug? Both tickets have SKYmiles # shown.

13090,@AmericanAir One week later...still waiting on my reply from AA customer relations :(
13108,@united you will have to directly call me   For that as I have no energy  To be on waiting for hours  and hours ....
13109,@united yes your baggage drop off line is too damn long. I missed my flight.
13146,"@DeltaAssist - left hand/right hand not talking to each other regarding my bag, delayed now 3days. Very abnormal for Delta!!!!"
13154,"@united I'm at the airport now. Your folks finally delivered a bag, unfortunately it's not mine.  Terrible."
13162,"@united you are killing me! In 3 days time, three delayed flights, one canceled, one rescheduled, two airplane switches, and finally no AC!?"
13179,waiting at #SeaTac to board my @JetBlue flight back to #LGB. cant quite believe that #RF2014 is over and im going home already.
13183,@AmericanAir very disappointed in the service on this flight. Y'all are normally a lot better than this.

14590,@GarrettRWang @AmericanAir I think that's a better way to go. Violence is much worse than showing skin.
14600,@united customer service at @Houstonairport has been awful. Currently watching an agent argue with a customer at gate B85A. Unprofessional.
14629,Waiting for my delayed @SouthwestAir flight to begin...can't get back home soon enough!

35379,At @HeathrowAirport waiting for 10.35 @AmericanAir flight to. #NYC
35405,@AmericanAir why does it take so long to add points to BA exec club. It's never automatic. I always have to make claim &amp; wait 8 weeks?
35426,not a bad 48 hours: @VirginMoney (England's best bank) and @VirginAmerica (America's best airline) both successfully had their IPOs.
35498,@united I need you to compensate me for wasting my day. Rebooked flight does not have wifi.
35519,"@AmericanAir How to file a complaint? Reedham Patel VPoperations #LAX promised discounted airfare to travel home 4 xmas,gave us fake conf#"

36386,@shaney852 @DeltaAssist @Delta no problems with @USAirways
36422,"Amusingly, while flight on @United is ~ 4.5 hours late, the estimated arrival time is only 1.5 hours late. Getting a faster plane? UA 3799"
36428,Perils of travel. @united flight to dc isn't only delayed but there are no staff at the desk to keep passengers informed.
36454,@SouthwestAir I used your airlines for a vacation and missed my connecting flight and all you can give me is $200 in vouchers?
36501,@AmericanAir Hello! Please send someone to fix the audio video system on AA 70/71 DFW-FRA. The sys.   Fwide issue affects everyone on board.
36615,Can't believe @AmericanAir is 3 hours late. I should be getting home in an hour not leaving the airport in an hour
36630,American Airlines @americanair is a mess at Laguardia. No boarding passes are printing and the line is out the door. Get it together!
36647,Losing a possible job opportunity with @JetBlue cuz I can't get home in time cuz @AmericanAir screwed me over!
36695,I will never ever fly @united or through @fly2ohare again in my life. I've never had a single flight go as planned. Horrible service.

37040,"Being late stinks...cheers to @HawaiianAir, @AlaskaAir and @JetBlue for getting there on time http://t.co/hkfuMyCxpU http://t.co/gZvJpNC7tZ"
37136,"@AmericanAir no problem. Also, will they count toward elite status?"
37138,@SouthwestAir why are your employees so rude!! Rude worker at the counter....now 3 southwest flights in a row with a rude flight attendant!
37184,.@SouthwestAir How long does it take to fuel a 737-300? We're 50 mins late and last I checked gas was cheaper in HOU than PHX. Lol

37252,"_@bonniegrrl: If you hate @united airlines, read this: http://t.co/VS6gHOzBcG_"
37318,Well no more @JetBlue flights for me I guess. Ridiculous.
37412,So disappointed to hear @JetBlue is going to start charging for baggage
37419,Dammit @JetBlue. A tiered structure for bag fees based on fare class is set up to fail from day 1. Pls don't drive me to @SouthwestAir.
37465,@united you are the worst customer service based airline that I ever had to deal with. This will be the last time I will ever book with you.
37485,miss the days when @jetblue was the non-airline airline. http://t.co/jaH0nyLYEB
37546,@JetBlue very disappointed about your new plans to basically ruin everything your airline became successful with #MoneyOverCustomers
37564,Awful news. Bad job @JetBlue - you were the last glimpse of affordable humanity in air travel. http://t.co/wOvFLDSfXc
37569,@SouthwestAir - missed voucher because I was in food court. Glad seat mate mentioned it. TYVM. Suggested an inclusive system.
37610,"@adambarrett101 yeah, not happy with @JetBlue. 1st they create a first class cabin &amp; now reducing leg room. Losing what's special about them"
37629,@rothsara @Oregonian RIGHT?!?! I'M SO MAD @JetBlue
37675,@JetBlue now just another airline. :/. Can't wait for @SouthwestAir to provide direct/nonstop from BOS to SJU.
37698,@AmericanAir Your consistent poor service and delays are pathetic. Should've flown United.
37789,Worst. MT@BostonDotCom: JetBlue doesn't love us anymore. @JetBlue cuts leg room adds bag fees http://t.co/u4uJo2gDed http://t.co/8bQUMCvlHa.
37791,"oh, @JetBlue I guess it was bound to happen, but I have to admit I'm a little disappointed in my fave airline. #baggagefees #lesslegroom"
37802,"Oh @JetBlue today is a sad day for B6 loyalists. I know you're touting your new ""options"" but your service/no bag fees ARE what make u great"
37807,Hey @JetBlue! What you're doing really stinks!
37933,"So disappointed @JetBlue for adding a checked bag fee. @SouthwestAir, can you add direct flights from SF to Boston, please."
37976,@JetBlue is adding bag fees for its cheapest tickets? And less leg room? Looks like I'll be sticking with @SouthwestAir from now on. #fail
37986,"Also, cannot wait to get rid of my @AmericanAir status. They starve us on every flight! Even flights when we are delayed ON the plane."
38016,"""@JetBlue: @claudia____xoxo Claudia, you must be at least 18 years or older."" Am I missing something? Jet blue get into the porn industry?"

38094,@VirginAmerica no worries. Not your fault and I shouldnt really complain about the rain. We need it in CA!

38662,DFW is home base for @AmericanAir but apparently they don't staff anyone in maintenance. STILL waiting for someone to come look at our plane
38667,@AmericanAir  Stuck on a plane in Dallas. Major delay. No options.  Terrible.
38704,@united that doesn't sound like an apology.  Having to check a carry-on 1 way is an inconvenience. Having to check it 2 ways is ridiculous.
38705,@SouthwestAir tring to change internationa itinareray usa to jamaica. All I get is music. is there a better number. # terrible

39626,@DeltaAssist trying to get to PVD.  Flight 1858 from Austin delayed and will miss connecting flight in ATL.
39663,@AmericanAir doesn't have staff that recognize how to prioritize passengers with immediate issues and baggage issues!
39674,I really hate when my luggage comes out and my clothes are everywhere #unitedairlines @united
39681,Why did @JetBlue promise our flight Guardians of the Galaxy and then give us The Fault in Our Stars? The entire plane is crying now.
39719,So my @jetblue flight is 2 hrs delayed coming in from Bogota Columbia....BOGOTA COLUMBIA???!!!??? #NAILBA33
39776,@AmericanAir can you reference this convo? I would like to file a complaint.
39781,"@united  I think u r getting better u screw silly things up, no water on UA1616 ORD to SFO ... Hint CA's drink H2O all gone before lvng gate"
39787,4th time in a row I've been substantially delayed or had my bag lost or both by @AmericanAir #awfulcustomerservice
39801,"Delayed at IAD because flight attendant is MIA, I just want to go home @united"
39871,"Really @united? Another Skywest YXE delay on UA6303. The aircraft sit out all nite, figure out a way for on time deps in the winter from XE."
39909,"@DeltaAssist can a Kindle left in a seat pocket be recovered or is it a sacrifice at the altar of carelessness? 11/21, DL1604"
39911,@united yes bags arrived surprisingly but still can not believe how irresponsible and lack of care Unites employee acted in his situation!
39924,.@americanair absolute worst customer service. You should be ashamed. Thought @united was bad last time but you take the cake.
39968,"So @united just ruined my family vacation, they over booked the flight and BSed me around and now theres no other flights. FUCK YOU ASSHOLES"

40096,@united broken movie screen and having kids jab at my seat head the entire flight. Worst flight I've been on and it was the shortest. _
40099,"@united is hands down the worst airline of all time. There, I said it, and only feel slightly better."
40137,@DeltaAssist you guys have a weather plan for the northeast on Wednesday? I'd like to get home in time and not pay a insane change fees
40162,@b_koll11 @AmericanAir They made you miss the play of the year. Sue.
40315,"Off to #Chicago with Jenna....well, if we leave #Omaha on @SouthwestAir....at least we were told what the delay is for so far."

40371,@AmericanAir I hate you
40382,@DeltaAssist your gate officer at gate 44 in Nassau will be the reason I cancel my delta loyalty
40398,@united @Dulles_Airport Incredibly unhappy that I paid $60 for my luggage only to find several expensive items in my pro makeup kit broken
40417,@mattcohen4real @AmericanAir That's horrible! D: They should treat you guys better!
40456,"Hey @DeltaAssist, coulda told me LAST WEEK that you only keep lost items at LAX for 24hrs. Does that mean if you found my phone, it's gone?"

40621,I cant believe I convinced myself to give @united a try again. Such a horrible experience compared to @JetBlue
40873,Our @AmericanAir flight attendant got on the wrong plane this morning and now were stuck in Green Bay because our plane cant fly w/I one.
41129,@SouthwestAir what is with delay of flight 3251. Was suppose to leave at 1:20. 5hr delay and still no info. Ridiculous.
41164,@DeltaAssist trying to make flight 993 delayed to ATL on 1584 let gate know
41200,"@southwestair, if your flight is delayed/boarding @ 7:50, customers come back at 7:45, NOT letting them on said plane is 100% unacceptable."

41677,2 thumbs up for @SouthwestAir  quickly squaring away issues from last nights #flight524
41690,.@united how is it that you feel you can trap passengers on a plane for over 3 hours with no actual hope in sight. Wtf is wrong with you?!?
41724,@DeltaAssist I submitted a refund request per my flights were delay yesterday and they told me they could provide me another flight
41761,@AlaskaAir at lax airport has the most disgusting angry black woman as manager.Calling people slaves.You guys need to fire that bitch.
41767,"@AmericanAir was a horrible experience, everyone was rude. Even the two managers we talked too. Never going with them again. Worst airline."
41805,"@AmericanAir I know it's been a tough day with the weather, but no excuses for rude customer service. Miss you @JetBlue"

42122,Has anyone else noticed an overall decline in @USAirways since merging with @AmericanAir? Customer service has taken a turn for the worse.

42675,&amp; now you wanna tell me the flight we've been rerouted to is delayed?! @united #furious
42685,@DeltaAssist the desk could have cared less. Your agent in So Paulo lied to me and told me I didn't need to recheck. Now I'm stuck

42915,@MatthewLush @JetBlue they're fucking stupid for doing this 
43089,@SouthwestAir trying to fly standby due to delay and told my husband can't fly with me. Wish you'd keep couples together on standby lists.
43117,@united the two incidents were unrelated. The luggage door on the plane broke
43191,Lol who else is clearly going to miss his or her flight? #thanksgiving @SouthwestAir
43203,@united what's the point of premiere status when priority tag on bag goes missing and I'm now waiting extra long for bag to show up?
43215,"Yet another @united fail. Not sure why I keep flying this airline. Delay, plane downgraded, waste of an upgrade."

68677,"@SouthwestAir Think KTN didn't make it onto my rez, no TSA Pre on boarding pass after check in. Something that can be fixed or too late?"
68701,@AmericanAir I have been e-mailing for the last two weeks and no one has contacted me. I experienced a horrible trip due to a delayed flight
68716,@united you are by far the worst airline with the worst costumer service I've ever dealt with. I'd rather Maylasian Air.
68721,Yikes. Sitting on the runway for an hour now and @SouthwestAir won't let people use the bathroom. Worst airline!!
68733,Hi @JetBlue You are kind and helpful! We on tpa-dca 250 and delayed several times (with 9 ppl 3 kids ahh) Curious why other flights on time?
68768,@united I'm more sorry about the lack of communication and poor costumer service from your end than the lost bag.
68807,@SouthwestAir Bag was missing wheel when flight arrived. Thought it would be covered under mfctr warranty. Wasnt. Can I file a claim?
68901,"@united UA362 1st class. Lots of broken glass under seat.  FA rude about getting it cleaned up, like my wife broke it rather than prev pass."
68948,"@united I hope you guys DO NOT fire the flight attendant from that unitedwithIvy shit. Rules are rules, and she was only enforcing them."

69533,Just wrote a very angry email to @AmericanAir . I better get at the very least a travel voucher after that nightmare trip

69610,"After arguing for hours on the phone you guys still claimed it wasn't your fault, this is the worst experience I've ever had. @AmericanAir"

69725,"@Delta I gave you the address, but ""delivery man George"" still managed to ruin my life. I'm taking my business to @SouthwestAir henceforth."

69859,@lynsthebest @united they lose my bags every time I fly with them too. Terrible. I'm sorry girl
69926,I have always taken @VirginAmerica and this bull never happens.
69928,@DeltaAssist - how does a sky priority bag not seamlessly hand off from Alaskaair to Delta? #disappointed
69937,I shouldn't have a complaint every other time I travel . @americanair this is ridiculous.
70053,@USAirways and @AmericanAir are the worst to deal with when it comes to a hotel refund especially when it is their fault by standing you!
70151,Airline with the worst customer service award goes to @SouthwestAir
70298,"@united 1st flight to Newark cancelled, 2nd flight delayed. No connecting flights to my destination in Ithaca. customer service was awful..."
70410,@tomcostellonbc @NBCNightlyNews @united I don't blame them. United need a culture change bad PR

70932,@kingisafink @united all bad
70933,@united JH - I'm rebooked now. Is spraying de-icing fluid into the APU and then pilots timing out a weather issue? Sounds like user error.
70935,It is a shame that one of our international students' luggage was lost on Jan. 4th but @AmericanAir has not yet been able to help us...
70940,@united flight 500 is into its 4th hour of on-tarmac delay. please advise why I am being told food is for purchase only.

71478,Worst flight (or lack thereof) experience of my life. I need to be done flying @united after this  one.
71489,"@DeltaAssist Help! I switched my flight but Delta switched my mom's flight, too. She had to pay to switch it back but now mine got switched!"

122995,@SouthwestAir You guys owe everyone on PHL flight 1962 big time. Major incompetence resulting in hours of delay time. #disappointed
122997,@DeltaAssist you need to hire more call center people. every time i call i have to wait for everrrrrrrr
123059,"@AmericanAir Some of the worst service ever out of JAN today.  So much for the New American, same old complacent service. Shame on you."
123094,"@DeltaAssist very disappointed in your customer svc. Status match from the early March still unanswered, @united responded in 5 days."
123112,Terrible experience with @AmericanAir really disappointed with their customer service and negative attitudes when they just lost our bags.
123139,@SouthwestAir your customer support is now worse than other airlines. 20 min on hold??? Ridiculous!!!!
123147,@AmericanAir the bastards still have not got back to me after I put in a claim as they lost my baggage...and their lost&amp;found doesn't exist
123160,@AmericanAir is the actual worst. Never again.
123161,@AlaskaAir another bad experience with Alaska Air.  2 big ones in  6 days.
123187,@united yes there is. You can get me to Ireland after redirecting me 4 times and ruining my vacation thus far.
123188,".@SouthwestAir gate agents who look up, sigh, and when you ask if they are ok respond its just question after freaking question &lt; !!"
123228,@united still waiting for my bags at baggage claim in Newark- for the past hour. This is ridiculous. Pull it together.
123241,@SouthwestAir did you know @Delta keeps customers on hold for at least a hour? Can you do better than that?
123302,Everytime I fly @united I leave on time and arrive to my destination early. Everytime I fly @AmericanAir I leave/arrive late. #airlineprobs
123304,Lost luggage one way...30 minute wait and no sign of it on the other end. @united successfully remaining the worst
123310,@KellySullivanNY @AmericanAir That's horrible. Did you tell them who you are.  Omg. If they knew they would of got you a private plane.
123398,"@SouthwestAir you owe me $8 bucks, I was NEVER able to connect to any of my apps, access email or open any other page other than yours."
123502,@SouthwestAir Everyone is missing their departing flights from #ABQ including myself. Limited help behind the check in counters.
123617,Tried to give up my seat DEN-ORD to a standby whos about to miss his sons wedding. United agent won't even consider it. @united #noeffort
123678,This is fucking ridiculous...40 min on hold with @SouthwestAir haven't even got a person on the damn phone
123734,@JetBlue fuck you
123777,"@united went thru most horrible flight exp ever: 2 reschedules, awake 24 hours, return flight canceled: http://t.co/ZtLgNzSD3X #UnitedSucks"
123785,@united I am sorry but this is the last straw. My last 5 flights with you were delayed. Sad you can't get it together.
123831,@JetBlue refused to give seat assignment at booking &amp; at online check-in. Must wait in line at airport. High baggage fees. Never again.
123953,Im never using @AmericanAir again!!! Waiting an hour for bags @dfwairport is beyond ridiculous! #getittogether
123955,@AmericanAir she is on her way to MIA on a 2 hour delayed flight. She has 1 hour to do immigration and get her connection. What a nightmare
123969,@DeltaAssist Can you help me with filing  a claim for per diem expenses because of delayed baggage?
124006,"After driving 10 hours from Chicago to Wichita, we get our bags from the airport and say goodbye to @SouthwestAir forever. Just awful."
124122,@AmericanAir had the worst airline customer service experience of my life. While boarding Evelyn from MIA said my luggage was too big (1/?)
124153,@VirginAmerica I wish there were tips to help me get someone to care about my lost bag #annoyed #smh
124159,@DeltaAssist I'm on flight 110 from Atlanta. Plane has computer issues for over 2hrs at gate. Asked to deplane then back on #frustrated
124180,"@AlaskaAir it's annoying that there are seats in first class available, but because I booked my ticket w/ miles, I can't get an MVP upgrade"
124182,@mattiseman @SouthwestAir I miss their facing seats on the plane. Go first class baby!!!
124210,@SouthwestAir So dissappointing.  Lost luggage coming back from LGA.  Ruined trip for my daughter and son in laws first trip to NYC.
124222,@carley_marissa @SouthwestAir the worst airline service ever.
124266,"Screwed by @DeltaAssist once again! Stuck in London and was denied boarding on the a flight, not sure why. Seems like racial profiling!"
124337,@SouthwestAir your flight attendants on flight 2519 Austin to live field are extremely rude.
124365,_@AmericanAir: @McAlps_ We're sorry you weren't aware of the changes to your flight. Do you need help rebooking?_ I don't mess with you
124381,"So sad, @AmericanAir ruined my baggage and their response is: ""Lady's perfume and handbags aren't  strictly necessary"" Very disappointed :("
124401,Seriously @JetBlue we've been waiting an hour for you to find one bag &amp; you still haven't found it. #wtf #unacceptable
124407,Not impressed with my @AmericanAir @British_Airways code share flight LHR to ORD. No inflight entertainment &amp; broken reading lights :-( Poor
124450,@AlaskaAir if I miss my flight because im stuck in Seattles ridiculously long security line what happens?
124518,".@FlyFrontier kinda sucks...I won't cheat on you again, @SouthwestAir"
124539,VERY DISAPPOINTED IN @AmericanAir
124607,@utscott15 @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir or any of the many carriers serving chicago.  Waits happen but the lack of transparency is ridiculous
124618,@united why is there a problem every time I try to contact united care online? Is the site broken? It needs to be fixed.
124662,"Wow @delta airlines, you really suck. And Judy from @alaskaair - wow! http://t.co/EK5LOyqqaV"
124732,So @SouthwestAir cancelled my 6am flight out of BWI at 9pm. Been on hold for 2+ hrs. trying to change w/no answer. Have they given up?
124746,@AmericanAir you suck you bumped me from a plane that worked to one you knew was broken and then hand us a 1800 number....fuck you
124791,"@SouthwestAir please talk to @Reagan_Airport about their ""terminal a shuttle"" that never shows up."
124799,@united don't understand why on a Monday morning the priority security line isn't open/available. #frustrating
124868,"Not only did I have to get up at 4am, now I'm stuck on a @SouthwestAir plane with ""electrical problems."" Eff off"
124900," _@AmericanAir: @ChrisMarsB We're sorry that you missed your flight, Chris. Here's our suggested check in times:  http://t.co/rwhttbkOja_"

125175,Stuck on the tarmac @united PHL. Trying to get to Aspen today. It looks like I will miss my connection in ORD. Please help
125184,@SouthwestAir What is the status of 3830 from MDW? Still says delayed but it is past that time.
125276,"@SouthwestAir After having me sit in MDW at w/ 5+ hr delay, you have me queue for 25m and counting to rebook... Staff your desks properly."
125301,@SouthwestAir has failed me! The one time I need to work while in the air is the time that my plane doesn't have wifi... 
125320,"@united, what else is new?... Your IAD to DFW is oversold b/c it's a freakin mini-cooper... Get your shit together and upgrade to a 737!!!"
125342,"@SouthwestAir Ew, a lady on this plane isn't wearing shoes and has her bare feet on the back of the seat in front of her. Worst flight ever."

125639,"@united why be in this business at all, if you cannot handle the volume at peak times? More than a 24 hour delay to get from CGY to Phily..."
125668,"@united Worst communication skills. Waited an hour at the designated carousel for luggage without any announcement, flight CLE to IAH."
125687,@SammyRosati @SouthwestAir uh oh - stuck in Chicago? #SouthWestAirlines

125771,"@SouthwestAir our flight #4656 was cancelled, then the next cancelled again. Been at the airport for 8 hours _"
125779,@DeltaAssist I received no response to my DM you ask me to send.
125788,@SouthwestAir Waiting 40 minutes now to talk to an agent for something I can't do online. Are you really 24/7? Or am I on hold till morning?

125860,Sorry @SouthwestAir ...you handled the #MDW shutdown very poorly. Confidently flying @Delta this morning. Can I count on you for return...
125875,Man kicked off @SouthwestAir flight over vulgar language on t-shirt http://t.co/fefUIEQURW via @fox2now
125891,Two of the flight crew for @SouthwestAir are about an hour late (so far) making me miss my connection. #ItsAlwaysSomething
125916,@united Why would the gate agent say there was no way for my husband to get from Knoxville to Wichita today after his flight delay?
125918,.@Chase rep just told me that @united MileagePlus Explorer card offers no rental car coverage outside US #customerservice fail
125942,@AmericanAir very dissapointed with yesterdays departure AA112 2hs delay without serious information to passengers!!!
125966,"@united Sent my claim + got automated message back that I have to go through baggage resolution, not link you sent. On hold for 20 mins now"
125978,"@SouthwestAir unfortunately, you've lost two customers. Lack of care for customers in distress is unacceptable."
126027,So remember when Billy Armstrong got kicked off a flight b/c of his trousers?Apparently @SouthwestAir is at it again. http://t.co/XCLHluRpQz
126047,"Not gonna lie. , can Ya stop changing my flight time? Truly appreciate it man. @Jetblue"

126132,".@ArnieK, yup, never been treated so poorly as a customer with @AmericanAir &amp; @USAirways. Actively moving over to @Delta &amp; @SouthwestAir."
126134,@KRLD @SouthwestAir I have no problem with that.
126158,@united that's ridiculous! There was no overhead bin space left by the time I got 2my seat all the way in the back.
126180,"@AmericanAir: is there a new number for combined US/AA customer service? After 55 minutes on hold, I'm starting to think no one is there."
126201,"Baffled by my experience with @united today. If I never flew this airline again, it'd be too soon."
126374,"@SouthwestAir wife's bag lost, no explanation, no follow up call as promised #withoutaheart"
126570,"Horrible and traumatic experience @united the worst flying experience ever, almost in tears! #NeverAgain"

126585,@DougBenson @united @ComedyZoneCLT Dammmmmmmn. Time for some edibles while you wait.
126598,"@AmericanAir again disappointment. Canceled flights, disrupting business and NO compensation. #worstairline"

126650,@RyanEversley @DeltaAssist I guessed poorly. Ha.
126681,@united i am never flying with you ever again. $200 to change a flight!?!? You're insane. Don't you know life happens sometimes you idiots
126699,@AmericanAir I will be contacting the @CFPB and filing a complaint because all your company cares about is stealing $ from customers
126703,@AmericanAir you guys suck balls today. Hour delay plus luggage delay. Boooooooo
126726,This shit has you put in all your info on @AmericanAir to say you have you go on @USAirways to purchase a ticket

126980,"@united after a 10 hour travel day, pressurization problems and a return to the gate in the final 30 min leg of my journey is not welcomed!"
126992,Lol! Worst reason for a flight delay ever! @usairways @americanair http://t.co/Cw39K4Rx5k
127050,@AmericanAir you ask for feedback but when I try to reach out I am only allowed to leave 1500 characters and I rarely get a reply.
127067,#virginamerica please just take me home. Still no reason for this delay and 3rd gate change. Killing us! @VirginAmerica
127084,@DeltaAssist I get to the BUF airport this morning and my whole itinerary is changed!!  Now I'm getting to CHT too late. What's up?!
127095,"@jeffjarvis On @united I have never seen a pilot left alone in the cockpit Whenever one leaves, a flight attendant enters."" That makes sense"
127138,If this @SouthwestAir flight out of Bmore is this late and 3 1/2 hours long then i am fucked  hope they hit the gas hard
127157,@SouthwestAir @towbinator I was trying to plan a future trip. I can tell u this utility has major problems. I don't believe it works fyi

127615,".@AmericanAir, yes we cut it close to catch AA2308 out of DFW.  Not a reason to get a rude stare from flight attendant Jenna when boarding."
127623,"@united is a disappointment. Flew from SAN to IAD. No reclining, no leg room at all, charges for wifi, tv! 5 hr long torture! Time to switch"
127660,.@SouthwestAir no one here at ATL is explaining why flt 265 to Ft Myers is delayed almost 3 hours. Can you tell me why?
127679,"@AmericanAir after 2hrs, 3 customer service agents, and complete inconsistency on flight change fees - still no help from AA. never again."
127754,"@AmericanAir @djexcel the customer, especially an exec plat, should not have to elevate their own issues. What are you here for?"
127781,@AmericanAir they refused to take it! They said it was external damage. Poor user experience!
127830,@AmericanAir I don't think I will ever be able to- the service provided by EVERYONE thus far has been incredibly rude and unhelpful.
127835,@AmericanAir You are TERRIBLE worst I've ever been on and I've been on A LOT of planes.
127909,"@JetBlue Thanks, but sudden sad occasion (thus no seat choice) and separate center seats...No way to be enjoyable this time."

128279,@DeltaAssist on FLIGHT 1830 fSLC TO JFK. potential delay. If flight cancels what is first flight sat? I have delta #402 JFK TO LHR SAT
128302,@united To outsource all airport agents is ridiculous idea that will tank your customer service!!
128387,@SouthwestAir so sad that my flight's delayed 2 hrs &amp; I only have 71% left on my phone. It's a gamble...I may need 2 buy a book. #betonblack
128455,"@SouthwestAir I guess if I don't want my bag ruined with no assistance for the 3rd time, I'll have to fly @united or @AmericanAir"
128485,@Julius_Thomas @AmericanAir that's too bad!  they should give you a couple of complimentary drinks next time!
128502,@NickNguyen_ @SouthwestAir I'll never fly with them ever again.
128508,@united patience is meant for an hour or two. Bad equipment that causes an extra day is #badforbusiness #UnitedAirlines
128523,@united your agents told us our bags were at SJU. When we arrived they were back at EWR. Our vacay is officially ruined!
128540,@united its been 8 weeks since I submitted my claim for lost luggage. I have still not received my refund.
128558,@united you have successfully fucked my travel up two days in a row. This is why I will never nor my family will use you ever again
128602,"@AmericanAir is an absolute joke. Never flown with them and not had a delay, now sitting on a 2 hour delay at Shreveport. "
128694,@AmericanAir we board flight 253 to Maui and are told the co-pilot another 20 minutes late? Why board plane/make us wait extra 30 in seats
128813,@SouthwestAir Are all you deal with are complaints?
128857,Flight delayed close to 3.5 hours @JetBlue JFK to PHX. Lucky I have work to do and shows to watch via wi-fi or my fist would be shaking.

129005,Very disappointed with your customer service over damaged bags @AmericanAir
129006,"A 50 minute boarding process for a plane from Vegas to San Francisco is completely unnecessary. You suck, @united."
129016,@SouthwestAir way to go SW. What service. We land in Albany and you have one working gate. Meanwhile we sit on the tarmac hating you.
129029,"Several dozen tired people waiting for bags at #Logan for almost an hr after 5 hr cross-country flight. Plz give an update, @VirginAmerica."

129100,Awful service from @united. Been sat on this plane that should have taken off 2 hours ago. Will miss connections. Won't be using them again.
129231,Detesting @AlaskaAir with the fire of a million suns. Never again.
129235,@DeltaAssist any programs if I want to switch back to Delta Sky miles? Left to go to Dividend miles couple of years ago.
129236,They gave my daughter the wrong boarding pass and made her miss her flight and wait through 3 standbys.Fuck American airlines @AmericanAir
129297,@VirginAmerica @VirginAmerica when does your service start to hawaii? I can't wait :)

129683,@DeltaAssist We have been on hold for over 30 mins twice - I need to change my flights urgently - do you have a live assist?
129717,@AmericanAir AA281 late due to a missing fuel cap. Unbelievable.

129822,Hey @JetBlue do you realize how much fun it is to get up before 5am only to wait hours at your terminal because of computer problems?
129827,@AmericanAir yeah AUS is where I'm headed to but I checked July 1st -9th and I never saw any flights with just MD80's
129854,@SouthwestAir announcing they're leaving early is usually 'foreplay' for blaming externalities for leaving late. #StopAlready
129859,@DeltaAssist short connect at ATL due to late depart from CVG. Connecting from 2315 to 1757...
129949,"because my @AmericanAir left half an hour late, missed my connection in OHare. have to go to Dallas, THEN CA. No guarantee on checked bags."
130000,@elliottdotorg After reading http://t.co/oKLPUtDzdC.  Go read your forums for FB @AmericanAir horrible.  Much  worse than article suggests.
130102,@united yes she did but customer service was basically non-existent. How luggage gets lost on a non-stop flight 1 hour away is beyond me.
130105,@sierrahull @SouthwestAir southwest airlines should be ashamed! What a debacle of an airline.

171662,@KhristiLauren @united this is disgusting. United should be ashamed of themselves for allowing their employees to treat people like this

171866,Definitely don't plan to use @united ever. I don't want my flights to be ruined by having to hear blatant islamophobia #unitedfortahera
171925,"so far, @united, @delta, and @southwestair have all participated in unacceptable islamophobia in their service practices."
171966,@omarsuleiman504 @united Just disgusting behavior. United Airlines is off my list for companies I will use if I fly.
172004,@united fix your shit
172021,@profpmj @MichaelRoss7 @DeltaAssist @Delta tough luck you all. I flew international many times with delta no issues. No airline flawless
172040,"Do something about the discrimination @united or lose business, this is ridiculous! I expected better from your company #UnitedForTahera"

172160,"Been on hold with @united for the last 20 min....dude picks up, says this is an international rsvp....lemme transfer u...another 20 min wait"

172366,"Ok @united this is a bit ridiculous. Booked over 24hrs ago and still can't get an email trip summary after phoning, using app, using web. "
172367,@united isn't it strange that non Muslims are boycotting your airlines over hate from your air hostess? #unitedfortahera
172415,@AmericanAir: Missed AA138 HKG/DFW. Any AA options for today??
172446,Fuck you @united airlines and your racist Islamophobic staff. https://t.co/jnlZHYoxLm
172631,@united: you just lost a frequent flyer. i want to contact orbitz to find a way to block you from my flight searches from now till forever.
172684,@DeltaAssist @lufthansa the guitars were left in Atlanta GA Were supposed to be shipped to us yesterday never came. Same story today. Why?
172685,I refuse to fly @united until they learn how to not discriminate. Pathetic behavior. #unitedfortahera http://t.co/kgNeC9ge1I
172710,"@AmericanAir Just when boarding is set to begin, you tell us our aircraft is out of service? After saying it would be on time? #neveragain"
172719,@Charalanahzard that's why you never use @AmericanAir lol
172877,@DonnieWahlberg @JennyMcCarthy @AmericanAir once you fly DWAir all else fail to compare 
172888,"Hey @united, the story is gaining traction. Your excuse of a statement should probably get reworked"

173222,@walterbiscardi @united @CNN I hope CNN reports on antisemitism as much as other religious hate crimes since it's nearly 6x that of others
173245,Suffering from TV envy on this @JetBlue flight.  #Ugh #BlankScreenBlues http://t.co/qXARDfihHT
173260,@united very disappointed will never fly with you guys again unless this issue of #discrimination is addressed
173295,@PetePeters21 @Gravess_ @YourAnonNews @TaheraHAhmad @united The Crusades were in response to Islamic terror. Some things never change.
173314,Hi @JetBlue. Are you expecting any delays from LGB to JFK tomorrow? I saw today's flts are delayed.
173372,". @JetBlue is the most inept airline i've ever flown. delay in one direction, cancellation in another. struggling to make it home. Thanks."
173386,more reasons why @SouthwestAir sucks -- stuck in Houston WITHOUT my luggage (read: EVERYTHING I OWN) for two days b/c of canceled flight.
173417,I hate that my husband's flight was delayed due to weather but I'm not going to take it out on @@SouthwestAir.  They can't control weather.
173504,Another day another lie from @SouthwestAir. It would be impossible to do a worse job than you have done this week. #disappointed
173526,"On @united flight from hell. Diverted from EWR to PHL, waiting to refuel in PHL then going back to EWR. To compensate, got a Biscoff cookie"
173573,@united I will never use your airline after the way you treated Tahera Ahmad. That flight attendant should be arrested.@unitedforTahera
173599,"Flight back to SFO delayed over an hour, no upgrade, no E+ seat (shrunken cabin), and now... #20 for takeoff. Ugh. @united #thankssmij"
173660,"@Jetblue I've been on hold 36 minutes. My flight was cancelled, I'm stranded and no one is helping, like..."
